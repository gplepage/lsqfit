Version 9.2 2018-03-18
======================
Minor update.

- MultiFitter.make_plot now has a choice of views (ratio, diff, log, ...).

- Minor fix in examples/nist.py to deal with changes in numpy.


Version 9.1.6 2018-02-19
========================
Fixes GSL documentation. Improved makefile.


Version 9.1.5 2018-02-16
=========================

- New setup.py to facilitate installations when numpy and cython
  are not installed. Also cython is now optional. scipy is now
  required (to guarantee that lsqfit will work even if the gsl
  library is absent).

- Slight improvement to MultiFitter's plotting capabilities.

- Fixed interface to scipy.optimize.least_squares so ignores
  if scipy version earlier than 0.17 (used to crash).


Version 9.1.3 2017-04-04
========================
Tiny changes:

- Another fix for a rare bug (an edge case) in MultiFitter.chained_lsqfit.

- Adds an extra feature in response to a request from a user
  of the corrfitter module: lsqfit.MultiFitter has a new
  keyword wavg_svdcut --- see the documentation.

- Minor documentation corrections.

Version 9.1.2 2017-02-11
=========================
Very minor release:

- New option fitname in MultiFitter: fitname(x) creates new name
  for chained fit link from old name x.

- Minor bug fix for MultiFitter.chained_lsqfit having to do with
  svdcorrection.

Version 9.1.1 2017-02-07
========================
Fixes a bug that caused MultiFitter to crash in unusual circumstances.

Version 9.1 2017-02-06
=======================
The only significant change is the addition of MultiFitter.

- Added lsqfit.MultiFitter which is a framework from organizing
  fits around a small number user-defined of models that are fit
  simultaneously to many different pieces of data using different sets of
  parameters. It was developed to support the corrfitter module, but is more
  general.

- Tiny bug fixes to wavg to cover certain edge cases.

- Faster tests.

Version 9.0.1 - 2017-01-11
============================
Tiny fix to setup.py so lsqfit compiles without gsl. I didn't quite have
it right in v9.0.

Version 9.0 - 2017-01-09
=========================
This version offers a major overhaul of the underlying fitting
strategies used by lsqfit, offering more modern alternatives which can
be more robust and/or much faster than before.

- New 'fitter' parameter in nonlinear_fit to select the fitting package
  used to do the actual minimization. Three choices are 'gsl_multifit'
  (default), 'gsl_v1_multifit' (previous default), and 'scipy_least_squares'
  (default if GSL not present). It is worth experimenting with different
  fitters on any given problem, since they are optimized for different types
  of problems. Sometimes one option will work where others fail. Also some of
  the options can be 2-3 times faster (eg, alg='subspace2D' or either of the
  dogleg options) than the defaults (which emphasize robustness). Additional
  fitters are under consideration. See the Tutorial section on Faster Fitters
  in the documentation.

- Extensively rewritten Tutorial with simpler examples, more plots, and better
  organization.

- lsqfit will now compile without GSL, using scipy functions instead.
  The GSL package (newly rewritten) is nevertheless recommended because of
  its many options. Ideally both GSL and scipy are available, together
  offering the most options.

- nonlinear_fit.set(...) is available to change default values for
  parameters like svdcut, fitter, and tol.

- nonlinear_fit is almost but not quite backwards compatible. Setting
  alg='lmder', for example, will not work unless fitter='gsl_v1_multifit',
  which is not the default. Also analyzers aren't available for everything.

- nonlinear_fit ignores correlations in the data if udata=(x,y) is
  specified rather than data=(x,y) in the argument list. Uncorrelated fits can
  be much faster with 10,000s or 1,000,000s of y[i]s. Ignoring correlations
  that are actually there could make answers wrong, however.

- BayesIntegrator.__call__ now accepts an extra flag adapt_to_pdf.
  The default is True, which means that vegas adapts to the pdf.
  Set it to False and vegas will adapt to the function times the pdf.
  In either case, the results have an new attribute results.norm which
  gives a vegas estimate for the norm of the pdf (won't be 1 if
  the pdf is un-normalized, as is typically the case).

- lsqfit.empbayes_fit now accepts z0 arguments that are numbers, arrays
  or dictionaries (as opposed to just arrays). z in fitargs(z) uses
  the same layout as z0. This is a minor change but convenient since so many
  applications involve just a single z. This function also now accepts
  a prior distribution for z (see "plausibility" in the documentation).

- Slight enhancement of lsqfit.nonlinear_fit.format(...): setting
  pstyle=None suppresses the parameter list. Otherwise unchanged.

Version 8.1 - 2016-11-20
========================
MPI support for BayesIntegrator is now automatic --- ie, no need to set
parameter mpi=True (the parameter has no effect). Older code should still
work, however. See the documentation for vegas 3.2 for information about
using multiple processors.

Version 8.0.2  2016-11-05
==========================
Tiny change to keep lsqfit compatible with gvar v8.0 and later.

Version 8.0.1 2016-08-15
========================
Tiny (but somewhat conspicuous) fix in documentation.

Version 8.0 2016-08-14
=======================
The most significant addition is class BayesIntegrator for doing Bayesian
integrals  using vegas (see the tutorial section on Bayesian Integrals, and the
new case study on Outliers and Bayesian Integrals). Bayesian integrals are
used in situations where the Gaussian approximation implicit in lsqfit breaks
down. By combining lsqfit results with vegas it becomes feasible to do these
integrals even with 10s of parameters. BayesIntegrator is built on top of
gvar.PDFIntegrator and so requires version 7.3 or later of gvar.

There are two  additional changes, the second of which (caused by the first)
breaks backwards compatibility. These are actually changes in gvar (v7.3),
but they affect lsqfit:

- Function gvar.add_parameter_distribution has been added to allow new
  prior distributions, in addition to log-normal and sqrt-normal. This
  allows one, for example, to restrict a parameter to a particular
  interval (see the Overview section on Non-Gaussian Priors).

- To signal a log-normal prior for a parameter 'c' in nonlinear_fit one must
  now include an entry for prior['log(c)'] in the prior. Previously one could
  leave out the parentheses in the key, using prior['logc'] instead. The
  parenthesis are now essential. The same is true for sqrt-normal priors,
  where one would include prior['sqrt(c)'], not prior['sqrtc'].

  FIX FOR LEGACY CODE: To help convert legacy code, there is a new utility
  function that adds the needed parentheses: use

    prior = gvar.add_parameter_parentheses(prior)

  to add parentheses to keys in dictionary prior of the form logc or sqrtdd
  (which become log(c) or sqrt(dd)) in dictionary prior.

Other changes are behind the scenes: eg, more tests, more examples.

Version 7.1 and 7.1.0 2016-02-21
==================================
This version was made necessary by backwards incompatible changes in the
GSL library (with v2) used by lsqfit to do the fitting. The resulting
change in lsqfit *is* backwards compatible. Versions 7.1 and 7.1.0 are
the same.

- lsqfit now compiles with either of GSL versions 2.1 or 1.16. If 2.1 is
  used there are two (minor?) enhancements: 1) there is a more sophisticated
  stopping condition using parameter tol in place of abstol and reltol
  (see multifit documentation); and 2) there is a new fitting algorithm
  lmniel (in addition to lmsder and lmder) that is supposed to be faster
  when fitting very large amounts of data with relatively few parameters.
  Parameters abstol and reltol continue to work but are discouraged in
  favor of tol=(reltol, abstol) or tol=reltol.


Version 7.0 2015-07-01
=======================
This is a modest change but includes some backwards incompatible changes in
the routine --- hence the increase to v7.0.

- nonlinear_fit now supports priors with log-normal and sqrt-normal
  distributions provided parameter extend=True is set when it is called.
  A parameter 'c', for example, in a parameter dictionary can be assigned a
  log-normal prior by specifying a prior for 'logc' (or 'log(c)') in the fit
  prior, rather than for 'c'. This is the only change required to switch from
  'c' from a Gaussian prior to a log-normal prior; in particular the fit
  function can be still be expressed in terms of 'c' (rather than 'logc') since
  parameter dictionaries created by nonlinear_fit will have entries for both
  'c' and 'logc'. sqrt-normal distributions are handled the same way, but
  with, for example, 'sqrtc' or 'sqrt(c)' instead of 'logc'. This
  functionality was available in earlier releases using the function decorator
  @transform_p, which is no longer needed and has been removed.This means that
  fit.transformed_p is gone too --- just use fit.p.

- lsqfit.wavg no longer stores chi2, dof, etc as attributes of the
  function. These are all attributes of the result returned by
  wavg.

- debug=True checks for more errors. In particular it now looks for
  stray GVars (not from the parameters) in fit functions. The only
  way a GVar should get into a fit function is through the parameters.
  Having other GVars there used to lead to a very obscure error message.
  Running with debug=True gives a slightly more comprehensible message.

- fixed bug in nonlinear_fit.format which sometimes put stars in the wrong
  place.

- modified nonlinear_fit.format to list extra entries generated when
  using log-normal or sqrt-variables. So for a log-normal variable 'logc',
  results for both 'logc' and 'c' will appear in the formatted output.

Version 6.1.3 - 2015-06-17
===========================
Changed to pip + distutils for installation. Fixed inconsistencies in
INSTALLATION.txt.

Version 6.1.2 - 2015-06-16
==========================
Going back to distutils instead of setuptools. The latter doesn't work well
with cython.

Version 6.1.1 - 2015-06-16
==========================
Fixed trivial error in MANIFEST.in which prevented building.

Version 6.1 - 2015-06-16
==========================

With this version gvar is no longer bundled with lsqfit. setuptools will
try to install gvar if it is absent; otherwise it can be installed directly
(pip install gvar). The undbundling facilitates the use of gvar by modules
unrelated to lsqfit. Except for the unbundling this version of lsqfit is the
same as the previous version and continues to run with the older (v6.0)
version of gvar. It also runs with the new version of gvar (v7.0), which
has some added functionality.

- setuptools is now the default installer, although distutils will be used
  if setuptools is not installed.

- documentation loses gvar sections.


Version 6.0 - 2014-11-01
========================

This upgrade deals with some issues created by the most recent update  to
numpy (v1.9.0). The verion number increases to 6 because a (very minor) part
of the gvar.powerseries interface had to change (and therefore by the rules of
semantic versioning one must  increase the major verion number). BufferDicts
are also subtly changed, though in a way that shouldn't affect much code.
A couple of enhancements are included as well.

- gvar.BufferDicts are now derived from collections.OrderedDict. This is
  a consequence of the numpy change, but it is probably a good idea anyway.
  The interface is the same but pickling has changed. This means that
  BufferDicts pickled with the old software cannot be unpickled with
  the new. A very minimal module, oldbufferdict.py, is included in lsqfit
  for converting old pickled data to the new format; see documentation
  inside the file. Data stored using json is unaffected.

- The power series coefficents of gvar.powerseries.PowerSeries variable
  p are now accessed via attribute c: p.c[0], p.c[1] etc. Formerly one
  could access the coefficients using array notation --- p[0] for p.c[0],
  etc --- but this no longer works with numpy. The old notation was a bad
  idea in any case.

- gvar.fmt_errorbudget has a new option called verify. Set verify=True
  to have the code check that the error budget is complete and has no
  double counting of errors; a warning is issued if this is not the case.

- Added arctan2 to the list of functions that work with GVars,
  using code from Matt Wingate. (NB, the documentation shows how to
  create additional functions (eg, erf(x)) using gvar_function.)

- Obscure bug fix in gvar.ode.Integrator allows GVars as the
  independent variables.

- Rearranged documentation now includes case studies. These are self
  contained examples that are extensively annotated (and relatively simple).
  There are only two at the moment but more are forthcoming.


Version 5.0.1 - 2014-09-13
===========================
This is a very minor bug fix.

- Modified gvar.mean(g), gvar.sdev(g), gvar.var(g) so that g can
  include elements that are not GVars. These elements are assumed to
  have zero error, so their value is their mean. This means, for
  example, that g can be all GVars or all floats or a mixture.

- Fixed bug in gvar.ranseed which caused it to crash under python3 in
  certain circumstances.

Version 5.0 - 2014-06-26
=========================
A minor upgrade to provide functionality for other libraries. The first
change is not backwards compatible, but is unlikely to break much or any
code (except mine).

- fit.svdcorrection is now the sum of all svdcorrections, not a vector. The
  sum is all that is needed to construct error budgets, which is the
  only use for fit.svdcorrection. The sum is easier to manipulate -- for
  example, two svdcorrections can now be added to give a composite
  svdcorrection (as opposed to concatenated before).

- Fixed innocuous bug in lsqfit.nonlinear_fit.format().

- gvar.dataset.Dataset.slice can now apply slices to multiple dimensions.

- Added __format__ to gvar.GVar. This converts the GVar to a string
  and then applies the format to the string. This was needed to make
  python3 and python2 function similarly in certain situations.

- More polishing of the documentation (especially about svd).

- Beginning with this version of lsqfit, version numbers will be consistent
  with the rules of "semantic versioning" (http://semver.org). The most
  important consequence is that any change that is *not* backwards compatible
  with the current interface (as defined by the documentation) will be signaled
  by a change in the major version number, where the full version number has the
  format major.minor.patch (so the major version number is 5 for version 5.0).
  A side effect of this is that increases in the major version number can
  be triggered by relatively obscure changes in the interface that will have
  no effect whatsoever on almost all existing codes. The current move to 5.0
  is an example.

Version 4.8.5.1 - 2014-05-30
============================
This release is almost identical to the previous release. It is mainly to do
with getting the software registered properly online.

- Small improvement to the user interface in gvar.ode. It now works with
  vectors of x values, returning vectors of y values.

Version 4.8.5 - 2014-05-29
==========================

- Bug fix so recent changes in lsqfit don't cause crashes on Windows systems.

Version 4.8.4 - 2014-05-23
===========================
Small bug fixes.

- gvar.dataset.Dataset objects now work with Python's pickle. Also
  Dataset objects can now be initialized from other Dataset object, or from
  dictionaries, or lists of key-data tuples (like dictionaries).

- lsqfit.wavg now works with priors.

- Removed calls to C's lgamma function because it isn't available to
  old C compilers. Use Python's math.lgamma instead, which should always be
  available.

Version 4.8.3 - 2014-05-21
==========================
Bug fix: the new svd system didn't work with older versions of numpy (earlier
than 1.8). It now does. The problem was in lsqfit; gvar was fine.
There was a related issue in gvar.cspline which is also fixed.

Version 4.8.2 - 2014-05-16
==========================
Very small additions to facilitate pickling and other serialization of GVars. Changed
gvar.evalcov and gvar.gvar so that newg = gvar.gvar(gvar.mean(g), gvar.evalcov(g))
for some array or dictionary g containing GVars creates a new array/dictionary
with the same means and covariance matrix. Added better documentation
on the gvar page about pickling gvars, and also added new functions
(dump, dumps, load, loads) for pickling collections of GVars.

Version 4.8.1 - 2014-05-14
===========================
Bug fix.

- fixed negative svdcuts (which one shouldn't use anyway), which were broken.

- gvar.cspline.CSpline functions now return scalars rather than 0-D numpy
  arrays when given scalar arguments.

Version 4.8 - 2014-05-12
========================
This release has a reworked framework for SVD cuts. The new framework is
simpler, but also more robust --- SVD cuts are applied separately
to each block-diagonal sub-matrix of the data-prior covariance matrix. This
is more accurate, faster, and uses less memory, though the differences
aren't substantial for most fits.

- svdnum is no longer an option for lsqfit.nonlinear_fit, raniter, etc.
  This parameter makes little sense in the new framework. Make svdcut
  negative if it is important to get rid of certain eigenmodes. (Generally
  it is better to keep the modes, but with larger variances. This is
  what happens when svdcut is positive.)

- New information included in the Settings part of a fit report:
  number of eigenmodes modified by SVD cut, time needed for fit.
  The number of iterations is moved from the top line of the report
  to the last line, with the time.

- Better notation for lsqfit.transform_p (mostly compatible with old
  usage).

- Added a new numerical analysis routine (joining gvar.ode and gvar.cspline)
  in gvar for manipulating power series representations of functions:
  gvar.powerseries. The numerical analysis routines in gvar have been
  adapted so that they work with GVars and/or floats. More will be added
  in the future.

- Fixed bug in gvar.cspline (derivatives not computed correctly); added
  better tests for cspline.

- Fixed documentation errors in gvar.dataset.

- gvar.dataset.avg_data(s) for a dictionary s now (optionally) issues
  a warning if different entries in s have different sample sizes. The
  smallest sample size is chosen for all entries in such situations.

- Added option to gvar.ode.Integrator to allow custom adaptive
  strategies. Also offers a different interface to the integrator.

- Fixed minor irregularity (not really a bug) in GVar.fmt:
  x = gvar(0.999,0.999) implied that x.fmt(2) gave 1.00(100) which
  is correct but non-standard (should be 1.00(1.00) and now is).

Version 4.7
==============
A minor upgrade but with one backwards incompatible change (that is unlikey
to affect much code). The incompatibility is the main reason for calling this
release version 4.7 rather than 4.6.2.

- GVars can be used with any comparison operator now (==, !=, >, >=, <, <=).
  The comparison is made with the mean value of the GVar, ignoring the
  standard deviation. This is to facilitate the use/design of numeric functions
  that are designed to work with either floats or GVars. The definition of ==
  and != has changed from the past. Before x==y for two GVars was true only if
  both their means and standard deviations agreed; now it is true if their
  means agree, but their standard deviations disagree.

- Can use keyword keys to specify the which keys to use and their order when
  creating a BufferDict from a dictionary-like object.

- Significantly more documentation for the gvar module, and some rearrangement
  and expansion of the overview documentation.

- New function gvar.gvar_function for creating new arithmetic Python
  functions that can accept GVar arguments.

- gvar.gvar(x, xcov) now works when x and xcov are dictionaries. This allows
  you to deconstruct a dictionary of GVars using gvar.mean and gvar.evalcov,
  and then to reconstruct the dictionary using gvar.gvar: e.g.,
  gvar.gvar(gvar.mean(g), gvar.evalcov(g)) rebuilds g when g is an array
  of GVars, or a dictionary of GVars and arrays of GVars.

- gvar has two new numerical analysis modules: gvar.ode for integrating
  ordinary differential equations, and gvar.cspline for creating cubic
  splines from 1-d data. These modules are adapted from standard routines
  so they work with GVars as well as floats, which is why they are included
  here. Additional modules will be added as the need arises.

- When printing an lsqfit fit using fit.format(), setting option maxline=True
  (rather than a number) now causes all data to be printed.

- Other minor rearrangements and clarifications in setup.py and a few other files.

Version 4.6.1 - 2014-02-02
===========================
Cleaning up some small bugs introduced with the new lsqfit.wavg. Also
introduced an approximate but potentially much faster *fast* mode for it.

Version 4.6 - 2014-01-30
========================
The main change here is an upgrade to lsqfit.wavg.

- Somewhat incompatible change in lsqfit.wavg: When averaging arrays or dicts,
  wavg used to ignore correlations between different elements of the
  array or dict. The new wavg takes account of all correlations between
  different pieces of input data. wavg returns a GVar if averaging
  a list of GVars, a numpy array of GVars if averaging a list of arrays
  of GVars, and a Bufferdict of GVars or arrays of GVars if averaging
  a list of dicts. In each case the return value has extra attributes:
  chi2, dof, Q, time, fit. The function itself also has these attributes,
  coming from the last fit.

- gvar.mean(g) now returns g unchanged if g contains objects of type
  other than GVar. This is useful for writing functions that must work
  with either GVars or floats as arguments: gvar.mean can be used to
  strip the sdev off of GVars where it isn't needed or wanted.

- New function gvar.asbufferdict(g) converts dictionary g to a
  BufferDict unless it already is one, in which case it returns g.
  The keys in the final result can be restricted by adding a
  a list of keys as a second argument: gvar.asbufferdict(g, keylist).


Version 4.5.3 - 2013-12-22
===========================

- Fixed bug in gvar._gvarcore that caused problems on win64 systems.

- GVar's __cinit__ has been changed to an __init__, which makes derivation
  from GVar possible. GVar also has new property: g.internaldata.
  This allows simplifies derivation from GVar --- see, for example,
  class WAvg in lsqfit._extras.py. Finally a cython declaration file,
  gvar.pxd, is installed for the benefit of other cython modules:
  cimport gvar gives the module access to the internal definitions of
  cython extension types GVar, svec and smat.

- lsqfit.wavg (weighted averages) now returns a variable
  of type WAvg which is a class derived from GVar (with all of
  its functionality) but with added attributes: chi2,
  dof, and Q which are the chi2, dof, Q from the wavg. In the past these were
  read off the function itself (eg, wavg.Q) but this is nonintuitive.
  Now ans = lsqfit.wavg(list_of_GVars) is a GVar with the extra
  attributes (ans.chi2, ans.dof, ans.Q). lsqfit.wavg still has attributes
  chi2, Q etc to help with legacy code. Also this is useful if the average
  is over a list of arrays or dictionaries (ie, a multidimensional random
  variable). In this case the individual GVars in the result have chi2s, etc
  as described above, while lsqfit.wavg has the chi2 for the entire set (ie,
  the sum of the chi2s for all the components).

Version 4.5.2 - 2013-09-26
==========================

- str(x) and repr(x) for GVar x both now return strings using the
  '2.31(10)' format rather than the older '2.31 +- 0.1'.
  The old format is still supported on input, but it will
  no longer appear in (default) printing. Use x.fmt(-1) to obtain the old
  format.

- Added gv.evalcorr(g) which calculates the correlation matrix of the
  GVars in g.

- gv.chi2 has a new option (fmt=True) that causes it to return a string
  (describing the chi**2) rather than the numerical value of chi**2.

- Operators > and < are now defined for gvar.GVars. This allows algorithms
  to order GVars, which is occasionally useful. The ordering is based upon
  the mean values. Operators >= and <= are still *not* defined, because of
  incompatibilities with == and !=, which look not just at mean values but
  also at all the dependencies. These incompatibilities suggest that one
  shouldn't define > and < either, except that there are times when it is
  quite useful to be able to order a numerical data type for algorithmic
  reasons. The setup here is a compromise (kludge?).

- Fixed very minor bug in lsqfit.nonlinear_fit.format().


Version 4.5.1 - 2013-08-13
==========================

- polishing/minor fixes for nonlinear_fit.simulated_fit_iter. Also now has
  a bootstrap option.

- copy.copy and copy.deepcopy now work with GVars.

- very minor fix to gvar.uncorrelated


Version 4.5 - 2013-07-31
========================

- nonlinear_fit.simulated_fit_iter generates fits of new simulated
  data that is generated randomly from the original fit data. This
  data is useful for testing fits and tuning parameters in them.
  Simulated data has the same covariance matrix as the original data but
  its mean values fluctuate around values given by the fitting
  function evaluated at user-specified parameter values p=pexact.
  The values in pexact are the "correct" values that should
  be obtained from a fit of the simulated data --- that is, the
  results of the fit to simulated data should agree with pexact
  to within errors. Knowing the correct answers for the fit
  parameters ahead of a fit allows for very realistic testing. See
  the documentation in the Tutorial section on Testing Fits with
  Simulated Data for more information.

- nonlinear_fit.format() now adds 1 to 5 stars at the end of any
  parameter line where the parameter and the prior differ by more
  than 1 to 5 (or more) standard deviations, respectively. Stars
  are also added when fit data is printed out where fit data
  and the fit differ by more than 1 standard deviation. These are
  meant to draw attention to potential problems.

- New function: gvar.chi2(g1, g2) computes the chi**2 of g1-g2, where
  g1 and g2 are (multi-dimensional) distributions. One of g1 or g2 can
  contain numbers instead of GVars (and/or can be missing entries
  contained in the other). Also gvar.chi2(diff) where diff = g1 - g2
  equals gvar.chi2(g1, g2).

- gvar.dataset.avg_data has new option specified by parameter noerror.
  Setting noerror=True causes avg_data to compute averages but not
  the errors in those averages.

- gvar.ranseed() called without an argument generates its own random
  seed to reinitialize the numpy random number generates. The seed is
  returned by the subroutine and can be used to recover the random
  number stream in later work. The seed is also stored in gvar.ranseed.seed.
  The idea is to use gv.ranseed() at the start of a code and print out
  gvar.ranseed.seed so that the seed can, if desired, be used to recreate
  the same random numbers in a later run. The key here is the 'if desired';
  usually you might not care to recreate a run unless something unusual
  happens.

- The tutorial in the documentation has a new section (at the end)
  with a pedagogical discussion of simple fit strategies.

Version 4.4.4 - 2013-07-07
==========================

- gvar.SVD sometimes complains that "SVD failed to converge". This is a
  numpy.linalg problem (that might be solved by *not* linking with atlas).
  Have introduced a back up routine (numpy.linalg.eigh) that is tried when
  this error is encountered.

- lsqfit.wavg now accepts a list of dictionaries (containing GVars or
  arrays of GVars), as well as lists of GVars or arrays of GVars.

- Modest optimization for gvar.evalcov. Small optimizaitons for gvar.svec
  and gvar.smat.

- Fixed bug in svec.add (where one or other svec is size=0 svec)

- Fixed very minor bug in gvar.gvar() (makes, eg, gvar(array(1.)) work).

Version 4.4.3 - 2013-04-06
==========================

- Improved syntax for @transform_p from lsqfit. The old syntax still works
  but the new syntax is simpler: 1) use @transform_p(priorkeys,0) instead
  of @transform(prior,0,'p'); and 2) fit.transformed_p is the same as
  fit.p but augmented with the exponentials of any log-normal terms, etc.

- Rules for initial values p0 in nonlinear_fit are more flexible: p0 can
  include keys that are not in prior (these will be ignored, unless prior
  is None). This makes it more likely that an old p0 will be useful for
  priming a new fit.

Version 4.4.2 - 2013-03-16
===========================
This is another minor upgrade.

- Evaluation of logGBF in nonlinear_fit was having problems (in one user's
  code, at least) with very large covariance matrices. This is now fixed.

Version 4.4.1 - 2013-03-14
==========================
This is a very minor upgrade.

- Set default svdcut=1e-15 instead of None in nonlinear_fit. This cut is
  very small and so usually has negligible impact in cases where an svdcut is
  unneeded. It protects against minor roundoff errors that arise relatively
  frequently, even in fairly simple problems. It also prevents problems from
  exact zero modes in the data or prior. One might argue that it would be
  useful to expose these last problems, rather than dealing with them quitely,
  but dealing with much more common minor roundoff errors seems more important.

- exp(fit.logGBF) is the probability (density) for generating
  the fit data from the input fit model, assuming Gaussian statistics.
  It used to be proportional to that probability; the
  proportionality factors are now included. This change will have no
  impact at all on almost all uses of logGBF. Change made more for the sake of
  clarity than utility.

- More documentation, including a tutorial section on chained fits and more
  discussion of svd cuts.

Version 4.4 --- 2013-02-13
==========================

- New function gvar.deriv(f, x) computes df/dx where f and x
  are gvar.GVars, and x is independent (ie, x has only one non-zero
  element in x.der). A ValueError exception is raised when x
  is dependent on other GVars. f can also be an array of GVars
  or a dictionary of GVars and/or arrays of GVars. GVars also
  have a method which computes the derivative: f.deriv(x).

- Small code improvements to lsqfit.transform_p.

Version 4.3.1 --- 2013-02-10
============================

- Slight refinements to the support for log-normal, etc
  priors. The decorator name is changed (but the old
  name is aliased to the new, to support legacy code
  (if there is any)).

Version 4.3 --- 2013-02-10
===========================

- Works with python3.3 (and numpy >= 1.17 which is necessary for 3.3).
  Fixed minor errors in gvar.BufferDict.__str__ and in some of the unittests
  that showed up with python3.3.

- Support for log-normal and "sqrt-normal" prior distributions for fit
  function parameters. The idea is to use parameters with names like
  "log(a)" instead of "a" in the prior, while expressing the fit
  function in terms of "a": so prior["log(a)"] is
  specified in the prior but not prior["a"], while the fit
  function uses parameter p["a"] but not p["log(a)"]. Parameter
  p["a"] has a log-normal distribution because prior["log(a)"] is
  a gaussian variable. See the section "Positive Parameters" in
  the overview section of the html documentation, for more
  information.

- gvar.dataset.Dataset changed to an OrderedDict from a dict. This mostly
  doesn't matter. Just about the only non-cosmetic effect concerns what
  happens when an svdcut is applied to the output of avg_data --- small
  differences arise when rows and columns of the covariance matrix are
  interchanged (roundoff error).

- Changed == and != for GVars to allow comparisons with non-GVar types; a GVar
  compares as not equal to a non-GVar unless its mean equals the
  non-GVar and its standard deviation is zero. Note that >, <, etc are
  not defined for GVars since GVars are not unambiguously ordered
  --- eg, a number drawn from the distribution 100(99) will be
  larger than one from 101(1) almost 50% of the time, even though
  100 < 101.

- Had too many pieces in the version number, so moved to 4.3. A
  third component, as in 4.3.1, will indicate bug fixes and minor
  features. There has been a lot added since 4.2 started (see 4.2.2).

Version 4.2.7.2 --- 2013-01-29
==============================
gvar.fmt_errbudget(...) has new parameter to specify column widths. This
allows for longer names for outputs and inputs.

Version 4.2.7.1 -- 2013-01-14
=============================
Adds a further tweak to the exception handling inside fit functions ---
slightly more robust than what is in 4.2.7.

Version 4.2.7 -- 2013-01-13
===========================
Another minor update:

- gvar.raniter and gvar.bootstrap_iter now work with single gvar.GVar's as
  arguments (in addition to the more useful cases of arrays and
  dictionaries). This makes them more consistent with the other utility
  functions.

- Python errors buried inside fit functions now result in slightly more
  intelligible error messages. Added two new unittests for such
  exception-handling.


Version 4.2.6 -- 2012-12-03
===========================
This is a minor update:

- Adds load (and loads) and dump (and dumps) methods to gvar.BufferDict to
  facilitate saving serialized BufferDicts in files (or strings) for later
  use. This is particularly useful when the BufferDict contains gvar.GVars
  since the correlations between the different GVars in the BufferDict are
  complicated to retain properly. These are implemented using pickle or,
  optionally, json. pickle already worked with BufferDicts. json was added
  because pickle is not compatible between python2 and python3. json files
  are also readable by non-python code (and by yaml). The json
  implementation has some limitations (around the types used for keys in
  the BufferDict, as well as types for the values) so pickle may be
  preferable except in situations where data must be moved from python2 to
  python3.

Version 4.2.4 -- 2012-08-18
===========================
This update is to fix a bug. Since version 4.2.2 lsqfit has been able to
deal correctly with statistical correlations between priors and the input
fit data. The code checks automatically for such correlations, and modifies
the definition of chi**2 appropriately if it finds correlations. There was
a bug in part of the code that checks for correlations, causing it to miss
certain situations. That bug is fixed in this update. Also

Other changes:

- Renamed gvar.orthogonal to gvar.uncorrelated, which is more intelligible
  (and also now has correct code).

- Fixed bug in gvar.GVar.partialvar (and therefore also
  gvar.fmt_errorbudget). The partial variance due to some GVar g should
  include the contributions from all other GVars that are statistically
  correlated with g. This previous code missed correlated but unreferenced
  variables that should have been included automatically.

- gvar.dataset.autocorr() is now done properly (with FFTs) and so can
  handle large datasets. It now computes autocorrelations for all
  intervals.

- lsqfit now issues deprecation warnings if the old classes GPrior,
  CGPrior, or LSQFit are used. These have been superseded in recent
  versions (by gvar.BufferDict and lsqfit.nonlinear_fit), and the old names
  have been attached to the new constructs, but the correspondence between
  old and new is only approximate --- hence the warning.

- Documentation improvements in the Tutorial.

Version 4.2.3 -- 2012-07-22
===========================
This version updates printing of GVars and of nonlinear_fits:

- Enhanced the formatting capabilities of GVar.fmt. If g is a GVar, then
  gvar.fmt() will create a string representation of g that shows the
  leading 2 digits of the error (used to be 1). The new code handles
  special cases much more effectively. For example very large or small
  numbers are represented using exponential notation (eg, 1.23(4)e+10 meaning
  1.23e+10 +- 4e+8). Also removed some bugs in the conversion from strings
  to GVars (eg, couldn't handle "-.2345(1)"). Added new unittests for fmt
  (in test_gvar.py).

- Changed the format of the fit report produced by
  nonlinear_fit.format(..). New format is more compact and more
  informative. In particular, indices for parameter arrays are included in
  the output to make finding a particular element easier. Also include
  errors on the fit values when data and fit are printed out. Output can be
  streamlined using new option pstyle='m'. (Setting pstyle='vv' gives
  output a lot like the old format.) Added unittests for format(..) (in
  test_lsqfit.py).

- Added new utility function gvar.fmt(g..) which formats every GVar in
  GVar/array/dictionary g (using x.fmt(..) for every GVar x in g).

- Scripts eg0.py ... eg5.py in doc/source now generate program output in
  files, with names like eg0.out and eg5b.out, that are read directly into
  the documentation. This simplifies the building of the documentation as
  changes are made to reporting functions (see above).

Version 4.2.2 -- 2012-06-07
===========================
This version involves significant internal change relative to the last
version, much of which will be invisible to most users. Significant pieces
of lsqfit and gvar were refactored for simplicity, with replacements for a
number of awkward constructions that reflected earlier but now obsolete
ideas about how the code would be used. A somewhat inconvenient change is
renaming the gdev module to gvar (for "gaussian variable"): every
instance of 'gdev' is now replaced by 'gvar', as is every 'GDev' by 'GVar'.
The old names were wrong and therefore misleading. (A tiny 'gdev.py' file
is included that aliases the new names with the old names, for use with old
code.) More usefully, the interfaces for many functions in lsqfit and
especially gvar were made more uniform: for example, almost any gvar
function that took an array of GVars as an argument can now also accept a
single GVar or a dictionary whose values are single GVars or arrays of
GVars. This is motivated by the overall design notion that multidimensional
distributions should be represented by collections of GVars: either as
arrays, or as dictionaries containing GVars and/or arrays of GVars, the
latter providing a much more flexible interface. These changes should make
the modules easier to learn and use, and certainly makes them easier to
maintain.

The bigger changes include:

- The names gdev and GDev are everywhere replaced by gvar and GVar (for
  "gaussian variable"). A new gdev.py module is included that aliases the
  new names to the old names, for use with old code. gdev.py is not
  installed with the rest of the code; if you need it (for old code)
  install it, for example, using "make install-gdev"; or copy it to the the
  directory containing the old code. Obviously, a better solution is to get
  rid of the old names.

- Correctly handles situations where priors are correlated with the fit
  data. Previously such correlations were ignored. This is the most
  significant change in functionality. It is a situation that arises rather
  rarely, but which is mishandled by older versions.

- Removed minor bug in lsqfit.wavg (used to ignore svdcut<0).

- Fit functions that depend only on the fit parameters (that is, have no
  dependence on an independent "x" variable) are now supported. This is
  signaled either by setting x=False in the fit data (data=(x,y)) or by
  leaving x out altogether (data=y) in nonlinear_fit.

- Rearranged gvar and lsqfit into packages instead of simple modules. This
  makes maintenance easier. It also reduces the number of names added to
  the module space.

- Relocated BufferDict into gvar. BufferDicts can still be constructed from
  dictionaries but no longer directly from arrays. This makes for a cleaner
  data type. BufferDicts are used internally in several of gvar's functions
  as the standard dictionary class (the standard array class is a numpy
  array). Unlike regular dictionaries, BufferDicts can be pickled even when
  filled with GVars; this is currently the only way to pickle GVars.

- Removed class GPrior from lsqfit. It isn't really needed any more since a
  dictionary works just as well. (GPrior is now an alias to
  gvar.BufferDict, which should allow older code to continue working,
  mostly.) Also removed classes BasePrior and NullPrior.

- svdcut and svdnum in nonlinear_fit still specify svd cuts for the fit
  data, but now can also specify svd cuts for the prior (no other easy way
  to do this now that GPriors are effectively gone). To specify a cut for
  the prior make svdcut and/or svdnum into 2-tuples, where the first entry
  is for the data and the second is for the priors.

- fit.svdcorrection is list with one or two elements. Either element can be
  a (1-d) vector or None. Can now be used directly as an input in
  fmt_errorbudget() (don't need/want to put [ ] around it).

- Merged class LSQFit and function nonlinear_fit from lsqfit into a new
  class called nonlinear_fit. nonlinear_fit is used as before, but is now
  actually initializing the class when it is fitting. Given standard usage,
  there was no reason to keep these two separate. (The old LSQFit class was
  originally meant to represent a fitter, but was mostly used to hold the
  results of a single fit; the new class nonlinear_fit class represents the
  result of a fit.)

- Redefined gvar.mean, gvar.sdev, gvar.var, gvar.evalcov, gvar.raniter, etc
  so that they all work with dictionaries as well as arrays. The
  dictionaries are converted to BufferDicts internally and results are
  returned as BufferDicts.

- The name of fmt_partialsdev is now changed to the more understandable
  fmt_errorbudget. Also it is part of module gvar, as well as being a
  method in nonlinear_fit objects. The name fmt_partialsdev is retained as
  an alias, to benefit older code.

- Allow arguments to GVar.partialvar and GVar.partialsdev to be None or
  single GVars or arrays/dictionaries of GVars. Arguments to
  gvar.fmt_errorbudget are also now allowed to be None, single GVars or
  lists of arrays/dictionaries of GVars. Previously each of these routines
  was more restrictive.

- Added a bootstrap_iter function to gvar to create bootstrap copies of
  collections of GVars (arrays or dictionaries).

- lsqfit's nonlinear_fit.bootstrap_iter does bootstrap fits on a list of
  bootstrap copies of the fit data. Now the list of bootstrapped data can
  be omitted and bootstrap copies are generated internally, from the means
  and covariance matrix of the data set. This is useful if the data has
  small errors (ie, is gaussian) which is often the case even if the fit
  parameters turn out to be non-gaussian (and therefore require
  bootstrapping).

- Created new options for gvar.gvar arguments: eg,
  gvar.gvar(["0(1)",(2,1)]) returns array [gvar(0,1),gvar(2,1)].

- Added new tools in gvar.dataset for handling random samples from
  distributions. These include functions avg_data(data),
  bootstrap_iter(data), and bin_data(data,binsize), as well as class
  Dataset for collecting random samples (in a dictionary). These additions
  are meant to supplant the old dataset.py module.

- Internal changes to how the data and covariance matrices are inverted
  could lead to small differences in results, due to roundoff error.

- nonlinear_fit.check_roundoff() now issues a warning, rather than an
  error, if large roundoff errors are suspected.

- svd analysis is handled by function gvar.svd which is now applied to a
  dictionary or array of GVars. It uses class gvar.SVD which is applied to
  a covariance matrix.

- nonlinear_fit.kappa no longer exists. It can be obtained using gvar.SVD.

- renamed nonlinear_fit.dump_parameters with nonlinear_fit.dump_pmean. Also
  added nonlinear_fit.dump_p and nonlinear_fit.load_parameters.

- Documentation streamlined. The Overview and Tutorial section was
  simplified a little, and has a new section on Troubleshooting.

- Speed is about the same except in cases where there are correlations
  between the priors and the fit data (where it is somewhat slower now,
  because it is doing the right thing).
