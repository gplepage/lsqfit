Overview and Tutorial
========================

Introduction
--------------------

The  :mod:`lsqfit` module is designed to facilitate least-squares fitting of
noisy data by multi-dimensional, nonlinear functions of arbitrarily many
parameters, each with a (Bayesian) prior.  :mod:`lsqfit` makes heavy use of
another module, :mod:`gvar` (distributed separately), which provides tools
that simplify the analysis of error propagation, and also the creation of
complicated multi-dimensional Gaussian distributions.
This technology also allows :mod:`lsqfit`
to calculate exact derivatives of fit functions from the fit functions
themselves, using automatic differentiation, thereby avoiding the need to
code these by hand (the fitters use the derivatives).
The power of the
:mod:`gvar` module, particularly for correlated distributions, enables
a variety of unusual fitting strategies, as we illustrate below;
it is a feature that distinguishes :mod:`lsqfit` from
standard fitting packages.

The following (complete) code illustrates basic usage of :mod:`lsqfit`:

.. code-block:: python

  import numpy as np
  import gvar as gv
  import lsqfit

  y = {                                 # data for the dependent variable
     'data1' : gv.gvar([1.376, 2.010], [[ 0.0047, 0.01], [ 0.01, 0.056]]),
     'data2' : gv.gvar([1.329, 1.582], [[ 0.0047, 0.0067], [0.0067, 0.0136]]),
     'b/a'   : gv.gvar(2.0, 0.5)
     }
  x = {                                 # independent variable
     'data1' : np.array([0.1, 1.0]),
     'data2' : np.array([0.1, 0.5])
     }
  prior = {}
  prior['a'] = gv.gvar(0.5, 0.5)
  prior['b'] = gv.gvar(0.5, 0.5)

  def fcn(x, p):                        # fit function of x and parameters p
    ans = {}
    for k in ['data1', 'data2']:
       ans[k] = gv.exp(p['a'] + x[k] * p['b'])
    ans['b/a'] = p['b'] / p['a']
    return ans

  # do the fit
  fit = lsqfit.nonlinear_fit(data=(x, y), prior=prior, fcn=fcn, debug=True)
  print(fit.format(maxline=True))       # print standard summary of fit

  p = fit.p                             # best-fit values for parameters
  outputs = dict(a=p['a'], b=p['b'])
  outputs['b/a'] = p['b']/p['a']
  inputs = dict(y=y, prior=prior)
  print(gv.fmt_values(outputs))              # tabulate outputs
  print(gv.fmt_errorbudget(outputs, inputs)) # print error budget for outputs

This code fits the function ``f(x,a,b)= exp(a+b*x)`` (see ``fcn(x,p)``)
to two sets of data, labeled ``data1`` and ``data2``, by varying parameters
``a`` and ``b`` until ``f(x['data1'],a,b)`` and ``f(x['data2'],a,b)``
equal ``y['data1']`` and ``y['data2']``, respectively, to within the
``y``\s' errors.

The means and covariance matrices for the ``y``\s are
specified in the ``gv.gvar(...)``\s used to create them: thus, for example, ::

   >>> print(y['data1'])
   [1.376(69) 2.01(24)]
   >>> print(y['data1'][0].mean, "+-", y['data1'][0].sdev)
   1.376 +- 0.068556546004
   >>> print(gv.evalcov(y['data1']))   # covariance matrix
   [[ 0.0047  0.01  ]
    [ 0.01    0.056 ]]

shows the means, standard deviations and covariance matrix for the data in
the first data set (0.0685565 is the square root of the 0.0047 in
the covariance matrix).

The dictionary ``prior`` gives *a priori* estimates
for the two parameters, ``a`` and ``b``: each is assumed to be 0.5±0.5
before fitting. The parameters ``p[k]`` in the fit function ``fcn(x, p)``
are stored in a dictionary having the same keys and layout as
``prior`` (since ``prior`` specifies the fit parameters for
the fitter).

In addition to the ``data1`` and ``data2`` data sets,
there is an extra piece of input data,
``y['b/a']``, which indicates that ``b/a`` is 2±0.5. The fit
function for this data is simply the ratio ``b/a`` (represented by
``p['b']/p['a']`` in fit function ``fcn(x,p)``). The fit function returns
a dictionary having the same keys and layout as the input data ``y``.

The output from the code sample above is:

.. literalinclude:: eg0.out


The best-fit values for ``a`` and ``b`` are 0.253(32) and
0.449(65), respectively; and the best-fit result for ``b/a`` is
1.78(30), which, because of correlations, is slightly more accurate
than might be expected from the separate errors for ``a`` and ``b``. The
error budget for each of these three quantities is tabulated at the end and
shows that the bulk of the error in each case comes from uncertainties in
the ``y`` data, with only small contributions from uncertainties in the
priors ``prior``. The fit results corresponding to each piece of input data
are also tabulated (``Fit: ...``); the agreement is excellent, as expected
given that the ``chi**2`` per degree of freedom is only 0.17.

Note that the constraint in ``y`` on ``b/a`` in this example is much tighter
than the constraints on ``a`` and ``b`` separately. This suggests a variation
on the previous code, where the tight restriction on ``b/a`` is built into the
prior rather than ``y``::

   ... as before ...

   y = {                      # data for the dependent variable
       'data1' : gv.gvar([1.376, 2.010], [[ 0.0047, 0.01], [ 0.01, 0.056]]),
       'data2' : gv.gvar([1.329, 1.582], [[ 0.0047, 0.0067], [0.0067, 0.0136]])
       }
   x = {                      # independent variable
       'data1' : np.array([0.1, 1.0]),
       'data2' : np.array([0.1, 0.5])
       }
   prior = {}
   prior['a'] = gv.gvar(0.5, 0.5)
   prior['b'] = prior['a'] * gv.gvar(2.0, 0.5)

   def fcn(x, p):             # fit function of x and parameters p[k]
      ans = {}
      for k in ['data1', 'data2']:
         ans[k] = gv.exp(p['a'] + x[k]*p['b'])
      return ans

   ... as before ...

Here the dependent data ``y`` no longer has an entry for ``b/a``, and neither
do results from the fit function; but the prior for ``b`` is now 2±0.5
times the prior for ``a``, thereby introducing a correlation that
limits the ratio ``b/a`` to be 2±0.5 in the fit. This code gives almost
identical results to the first one --- very slightly less accurate, since
there is slightly less input data. We can often move information
from the ``y`` data to
the prior or back since both are forms of input information.

There are several things worth noting from this example:

   * The input data (``y``) is expressed in terms of Gaussian random
     variables --- quantities with means and a covariance matrix. These are
     represented by objects of type :class:`gvar.GVar` in the code; module
     :mod:`gvar` has a variety of tools for creating and manipulating
     Gaussian random variables (also see below).

   * The input data is stored in a dictionary (``y``) whose values can
     be |GVar|\s or arrays of |GVar|\s. The use of a dictionary allows for
     far greater flexibility than, say, an array. The fit function
     (``fcn(x, p)``) has to return a dictionary with the same layout as
     that of ``y`` (that is, with the same keys and where the value for
     each key has the same shape as the corresponding value in ``y``).
     :mod:`lsqfit` allows ``y`` to be an array instead of a dictionary,
     which might be preferable for simple fits (but usually not
     otherwise).

   * The independent data (``x``) can be anything; it is simply passed
     through the fit code to the fit function ``fcn(x,p)``. It can
     also be omitted altogether, in which case the fit function
     depends only upon the parameters: ``fcn(p)``.

   * The fit parameters (``p`` in ``fcn(x,p)``) are also stored in a
     dictionary whose values are |GVar|\s or arrays of |GVar|\s. Again this
     allows for great flexibility. The layout of the parameter dictionary
     is copied from that of the prior (``prior``). Again ``p`` can be a
     single array instead of a dictionary, if that simplifies the code.

   * The best-fit values of the fit parameters (``fit.p[k]``) are also
     |GVar|\s and these capture statistical correlations between different
     parameters that are indicated by the fit. These output parameters can
     be combined in arithmetic expressions, using standard operators and
     standard functions, to obtain derived quantities. These operations
     take account of and track statistical correlations.

   * Function :func:`gvar.fmt_errorbudget` is a useful tool for assessing
     the origins (``inputs``) of the statistical errors obtained in various
     final results (``outputs``). It is particularly useful for analyzing
     the impact of the *a priori* uncertainties encoded in the prior
     (``prior``).

   * Parameter ``debug=True`` is set in |nonlinear_fit|. This is a good idea,
     particularly in the early stages of a project, because it causes the
     code to check for various common errors and give more intelligible
     error messages than would otherwise arise. This parameter can be dropped
     once code development is over.

   * The priors for the fit parameters specify Gaussian distributions,
     characterized by the means and standard deviations given
     ``gv.gvar(...)``. Some other distributions are available, and
     new ones can be created.  The
     distribution for parameter ``a``, for example, can be switched to a
     log-normal distribution by replacing ``prior['a']=gv.gvar(0.5, 0.5)``
     with::

        prior['log(a)'] = gv.log(gv.gvar(0.5,0.5))

     in the code. This change would
     be desirable, for example, if we knew *a priori* that
     parameter ``a`` is positive
     since this is guaranteed with a log-normal distribution. Only the
     prior need be changed. (In particular, the fit function ``fcn(x,p)``
     need *not* be changed.)

What follows is a tutorial that demonstrates in greater detail how to use
these modules in a selection of variations on the data fitting problem. As
above, code for the examples is specified completely (with one exception) and
so can be copied into a file, and run as is. It can also be modified, allowing
for experimentation.

Another way to learn about the modules is to examine the case studies
that follow this section. Each focuses on a single problem, again with
the full code and data to allow for experimentation.

*About Printing:* The examples in this tutorial use the ``print`` function
as it is used in Python 3. Drop the outermost parenthesis in each ``print``
statement if using Python 2; or add ::

  from __future__ import print_function

at the start of your file.

Gaussian Random Variables and Error Propagation
------------------------------------------------
The inputs and outputs of a nonlinear least squares analysis are probability
distributions, and these distributions will be Gaussian provided the input
data are sufficiently accurate. :mod:`lsqfit` assumes this to be the case.
(It also provides tests for non-Gaussian behavior, together with
methods for dealing with such behavior. See: :ref:`non-gaussian-behavior`.)

One of the most distinctive features of :mod:`lsqfit` is that it is
built around a class, |GVar|, of objects that can be used to
represent arbitrarily complicated Gaussian distributions
--- that is, they represent *Gaussian random variables* that specify the means and
covariance matrix of the probability distributions.
The input data for a fit are represented
by a collection of |GVar|\s that specify both the values and possible
errors in the input values. The result of a fit is a collection of
|GVar|\s specifying the best-fit values for the fit parameters and the
estimated uncertainties in those values.

|GVar|\s are defined in the :mod:`gvar` module.
There are five important things to know about them (see the
:mod:`gvar` documentation for more details):

  1)  |GVar|\s are created by :meth:`gvar.gvar`, individually or in
      groups: for example, ::

        >>> import gvar as gv
        >>> print(gv.gvar(1.0, 0.1), gv.gvar('1.0 +- 0.2'), gv.gvar('1.0(4)'))
        1.00(10) 1.00(20) 1.00(40)

        >>> print(gv.gvar([1.0, 1.0, 1.0], [0.1, 0.2, 0.41]))
        [1.00(10) 1.00(20) 1.00(41)]

        >>> print(gv.gvar(['1.0(1)', '1.0(2)', '1.00(41)']))
        [1.00(10) 1.00(20) 1.00(41)]

        >>> print(gv.gvar(dict(a='1.0(1)', b=['1.0(2)', '1.0(4)'])))
        {'a': 1.00(10),'b': array([1.00(20), 1.00(40)], dtype=object)}

      :mod:`gvar` uses the compact notation 1.234(22) to represent
      1.234±0.022 --- the digits in parentheses indicate the
      uncertainty in the rightmost corresponding digits quoted for the
      mean value. Very large (or small) numbers use a notation like
      1.234(22)e+10.


  2)  |GVar|\s describe not only means and standard deviations, but also
      statistical correlations between different objects. For example, the
      |GVar|\s created by ::

        >>> import gvar as gv
        >>> a, b = gv.gvar([1, 1], [[0.01, 0.01], [0.01, 0.010001]])
        >>> print(a, b)
        1.00(10) 1.00(10)

      both have means of ``1`` and standard deviations equal to or
      very close to ``0.1``, but the ratio ``b/a`` has a
      standard deviation that is 100x smaller::

        >>> print(b / a)
        1.0000(10)

      This is because the covariance matrix specified for ``a`` and ``b``
      when they were created has large, positive off-diagonal elements::

        >>> print(gv.evalcov([a, b]))         # covariance matrix
        [[ 0.01      0.01    ]
         [ 0.01      0.010001]]

      These off-diagonal elements imply that ``a`` and ``b`` are strongly
      correlated, which means that ``b/a`` or ``b-a`` will have
      much smaller uncertainties than ``a`` or ``b`` separately. The
      correlation coefficient for ``a`` and ``b`` is 0.99995::

        >>> print(gv.evalcorr([a, b]))        # correlation matrix
        [[ 1.       0.99995]
         [ 0.99995  1.     ]]


  3)  |GVar|\s can be used in arithmetic expressions or as arguments
      to pure-Python functions. The results are also |GVar|\s. Covariances
      are propagated through these expressions following the usual rules,
      (automatically) preserving information about correlations. For
      example, the |GVar|\s ``a`` and ``b`` above could have been created
      using the following code::

        >>> import gvar as gv
        >>> a = gv.gvar(1, 0.1)
        >>> b = a + gv.gvar(0, 0.001)
        >>> print(a, b)
        1.00(10) 1.00(10)

        >>> print(b / a)
        1.0000(10)

        >>> print(gv.evalcov([a, b]))
        [[ 0.01      0.01    ]
         [ 0.01      0.010001]]

      The correlation is obvious from this code: ``b`` is equal to ``a``
      plus a very small correction. From these variables we can
      create new variables that are also highly correlated::

        >>> x = gv.log(1 + a ** 2)
        >>> y = b * gv.cosh(a / 2)
        >>> print(x, y, y / x)
        0.69(10) 1.13(14) 1.627(34)

        >>> print gv.evalcov([x, y])
        [[ 0.01        0.01388174]
         [ 0.01388174  0.01927153]]

      The :mod:`gvar` module defines versions of the standard Python
      functions (``sin``, ``cos``, ...) that work with |GVar|\s. Most any
      numeric pure-Python function will work with them as well. Numeric
      functions that are compiled in C or other low-level languages
      generally do not work with |GVar|\s; they should be replaced by
      equivalent pure-Python functions if they are needed for |GVar|-valued
      arguments. See the :mod:`gvar` documentation for more
      information.

      The fact that correlation information is preserved *automatically*
      through arbitrarily complicated arithmetic is what makes
      |GVar|\s particularly useful. This is accomplished using *automatic
      differentiation* to compute the derivatives of any *derived* |GVar|
      with respect to the *primary* |GVar|\s (those defined using
      :func:`gvar.gvar`) from which it was created. As a result, for example,
      we need not provide derivatives of fit functions for :mod:`lsqfit`
      (which are needed for the fit) since they are computed implicitly
      by the fitter from the fit function itself. Also
      it becomes trivial to build correlations into the priors used
      in fits, and to analyze the propagation of errors through
      complicated functions of the parameters after the fit.

  4)  The uncertainties in derived |GVar|\s come from the
      uncertainties in the primary |GVar|\s from which they were created.
      It is easy to create an "error budget" that decomposes the
      uncertainty in a derived |GVar| into components coming from each
      of the primary |GVar|\s involved in its creation. For example, ::

          >>> import gvar as gv
          >>> a = gv.gvar('1.0(1)')
          >>> b = gv.gvar('0.9(2)')
          >>> x = gv.log(1 + a ** 2)
          >>> y = b * gv.cosh(a / 2)
          >>> outputs = dict(x=x, y=y)
          >>> print(gv.fmt_values(outputs))
          Values:
                            y: 1.01(23)
                            x: 0.69(10)

          >>> inputs = dict(a=a, b=b)
          >>> print(gv.fmt_errorbudget(outputs=outputs, inputs=inputs))
          Partial % Errors:
                             y         x
          ------------------------------
                  a:      2.31     14.43
                  b:     22.22      0.00
          ------------------------------
              total:     22.34     14.43

      The error budget shows that most of ``y``'s 22.34% uncertainty comes
      from ``b``, with just 2.3% coming from ``a``. The total uncertainty is
      the sum in quadrature of the two separate uncertainties. The uncertainty
      in ``x`` is entirely from ``a``, of course.

  5)  Storing |GVar|\s in a file for later use is somewhat complicated
      because one generally wants to hold onto their correlations as well
      as their mean values and standard deviations. One easy way to do
      this is to put all of the |GVar|\s to be saved into a single
      array or dictionary that is saved using function :func:`gvar.dump`:
      for example,  use ::

        >>> gv.dump([a, b, x, y], 'outputfile.p')

      to save the variables defined above in a file named ``'outputfile.p'``.
      Loading the file into a Python code later, with :func:`gvar.load`,
      recovers the array with standard deviations and correlations intact::

        >>> a,b,x,y = gv.load('outputfile.p')
        >>> print(a, b, x, y)
        1.00(10) 0.90(20) 0.69(10) 1.01(23)
        >>> print(y / b, gv.sqrt(gv.exp(x) - 1) / a)
        1.128(26) 1(0)

      :func:`gvar.dump` and :func:`gvar.load` are similar to the same 
      functions in Python's :mod:`pickle` module, except that they 
      can deal properly with |GVar|\s. They can be used to archive 
      (possibly nested) containers like dictionaries and lists that 
      contain |GVar|\s (together with other data types), as well as 
      many other types of object containing |GVar|\s. In particular,
      they can be used to save the best-fit parameters
      from a fit, ::
      
        >>> gv.dump(fit.p, 'fitpfile.p')
        
      or the entire :class:`lsqfit.nonlinear_fit` object::

        >>> gv.dump(fit, 'fitfile.p')
        
      The archived fit preserves all 
      or most of the fit object's functionality (depending upon
      whether or not the fit function can be pickled): for 
      example, ::

        >>> fit = gv.load('fitfile.p')
        >>> print(fit)
        Least Square Fit:
          chi2/dof [dof] = 0.17 [5]    Q = 0.97    logGBF = 0.65538

        Parameters:
                      a   0.253 (32)     [  0.50 (50) ]  
                      b   0.449 (65)     [  0.50 (50) ]  

        Settings:
          svdcut/n = 1e-12/0    tol = (1e-08*,1e-10,1e-10)    (itns/time = 8/0.0)

        >>> p = fit.p                             
        >>> outputs = dict(a=p['a'], b=p['b'])
        >>> outputs['b/a'] = p['b']/p['a']
        >>> inputs = dict(y=y, prior=prior)
        >>> print(gv.fmt_errorbudget(outputs, inputs)) 
        Partial % Errors:
                          a       b/a         b
        ----------------------------------------
                y:     12.75     16.72     14.30

Basic Fits
----------
A fit analysis typically requires three types of input:

#.  fit data ``x,y`` (or possibly just ``y``);

#.  a function ``y = f(x,p)`` relating
    values of ``y`` to values of ``x`` and a set of fit parameters ``p``;
    if there is no ``x``, then ``y = f(p)``;

#.  some *a priori* idea about the fit parameters' values (possibly
    quite imprecise --- for example, that a
    particular parameter is of order |~| 1).

The point of
the fit is to improve our knowledge of the parameter values, beyond
our *a priori* impressions, by analyzing the fit data. We now show how
to do this using the :mod:`lsqfit` module for a more realistic
problem, one that is
familiar from numerical simulations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD).

We need code for each of the three fit inputs. The fit data in our example
is assembled by the following function::

  import numpy as np
  import gvar as gv

      x = np.array([  5.,   6.,   7.,   8.,   9.,  10.,  12.,  14.])

The function call ``x,y = make_data()`` returns eight |~| ``x[i]``, and the
corresponding values ``y[i]`` that we will fit. The ``y[i]`` are |GVar|\s
(Gaussian random variables --- see previous section)
built from the mean values in ``ymean`` and the covariance matrix |~|
``ycov``, which shows strong correlations::

  >>> print(y)                      # fit data
  [0.004502(46) 0.001817(19) 0.0007362(79) ... 1.342(19)e-06]

  >>> print(gv.evalcorr(y))         # correlation matrix
  [[ 1.          0.99853801  0.99397698  ... 0.83814041]

   ...
   ...
   [ 0.83814041  0.86234032  0.88605708  ... 1.        ]]

These particular data were generated numerically. They come from a
function that is a sum of a very large number of decaying exponentials, ::

  a[i] * np.exp(-E[i] * x)

with coefficients ``a[i]`` of order 0.5±0.4 and exponents ``E[i]`` of
order i+1±0.4. The function was evaluated with a particular set of
parameters ``a[i]`` and ``E[i]``, and then noise was added to create
this data. Our challenge is to find estimates for the values of the
parameters ``a[i]`` and ``E[i]`` that were used to create the data.

Next we need code for the fit function. Here we know
that a sum of decaying exponentials is appropriate,
and therefore we define the following
Python function::

   import numpy as np

   def f(x, p):         # function used to fit x, y data
       a = p['a']       # array of a[i]s
       E = p['E']       # array of E[i]s
       return sum(ai * np.exp(-Ei * x) for ai, Ei in zip(a, E))

The fit parameters, ``a[i]`` and ``E[i]``, are stored as arrays in a
dictionary, using labels ``a`` and ``E`` to access them. These parameters
are varied in the fit to find the best-fit values ``p=fit.p`` for which
``f(x,fit.p)`` most closely approximates the ``y``\s in our fit data. The
number of exponentials included in the sum is specified implicitly in this
function, by the lengths of the ``p['a']`` and ``p['E']`` arrays. In
principle there are infinitely many exponentials; in practice, given the
finite precision of our data, we will need only a few.

Finally we need to define priors that encapsulate our *a priori* knowledge
about the fit-parameter values. In practice we almost always have *a priori*
knowledge about parameters; it is usually impossible to design a fit
function without some sense of the parameter sizes. Given such knowledge
it is important (often essential) to include it in the fit. This is
done by designing priors for the fit, which are probability distributions
for each parameter that describe the *a priori* uncertainty in that
parameter. As discussed in the previous section, we use objects of type
:class:`gvar.GVar` to describe (Gaussian) probability distributions.
Here we know that each ``a[i]`` is of order
0.5±0.4, while ``E[i]`` is of order 1+i±0.4. A prior
that represents this information is built using the following code::

   import lsqfit
   import gvar as gv

   def make_prior(nexp):               # make priors for fit parameters
       prior = gv.BufferDict()         # any dictionary works
       prior['a'] = [gv.gvar(0.5, 0.4) for i in range(nexp)]
       prior['E'] = [gv.gvar(i+1, 0.4) for i in range(nexp)]
       return prior

where ``nexp`` is the number of exponential terms that will be used (and
therefore the number of ``a[i]``\s and ``E[i]``\s). With ``nexp=3``,
for example, we have::

   >>> print(prior['a'])
   [0.50(40) 0.50(40) 0.50(40)]

   >>> print(prior['E'])
   [1.00(40), 2.00(40), 3.00(40)]

We habitually
use dictionary-like class :class:`gvar.BufferDict` for the prior because it
allows for a variety of non-Gaussian priors (see :ref:`positive-parameters`).
If non-Gaussian priors are unnecessary, :class:`gvar.BufferDict` can be replaced by
``dict()`` or most any other Python dictionary class. 

With fit data, a fit function, and a prior for the fit parameters, we are
finally ready to do the fit, which is now easy::

  fit = lsqfit.nonlinear_fit(data=(x, y), fcn=f, prior=prior)

Our complete Python program is, therefore::

    import lsqfit
    import numpy as np
    import gvar as gv

    def main():
        x, y = make_data()              # collect fit data
        p0 = None                       # make larger fits go faster (opt.)
        for nexp in range(1, 7):
            print('************************************* nexp =', nexp)
            prior = make_prior(nexp)
            fit = lsqfit.nonlinear_fit(data=(x, y), fcn=f, prior=prior, p0=p0)
            print(fit)                  # print the fit results
            if nexp > 2:
                E = fit.p['E']          # best-fit parameters
                a = fit.p['a']
                print('E1/E0 =', E[1] / E[0], '  E2/E0 =', E[2] / E[0])
                print('a1/a0 =', a[1] / a[0], '  a2/a0 =', a[2] / a[0])
            if fit.chi2 / fit.dof < 1.:
                p0 = fit.pmean          # starting point for next fit (opt.)
            print()

        # error budget analysis
        outputs = {

We are not sure *a priori* how many exponentials are needed to fit our
data. Consequently
we write our code to try fitting with each of ``nexp=1,2,3..6`` terms.
(The pieces of the code involving ``p0`` are optional; they make the
more complicated fits go about 30 times faster since the output from one
fit is used as the starting point for the next fit --- see the discussion
of the ``p0`` parameter for :class:`lsqfit.nonlinear_fit`.) Running
this code produces the following output, which is reproduced here in some
detail in order to illustrate a variety of features:

.. literalinclude:: eg1.out

There are several things to notice here:

   * Clearly two exponentials (``nexp=2``) are not sufficient. The ``chi**2``
     per degree of freedom (``chi2/dof``) is significantly larger than one.
     The
     ``chi**2`` improves substantially for ``nexp=3`` exponentials,
     and there is
     essentially no change when further exponentials are added.

   * The best-fit values for each parameter are listed for each of the
     fits, together with the prior values (in brackets, on the right).
     Values for each ``a[i]`` and ``E[i]`` are listed in order, starting at
     the points indicated by the labels ``a`` and ``E``. Asterisks are
     printed at the end of the line if the mean best-fit value differs from
     the prior's mean by more than one standard deviation (see ``nexp=1``);
     the number
     of asterisks, up to a maximum of 5, indicates how many standard
     deviations the difference is. Differences of one or two standard
     deviations are not uncommon; larger differences could indicate a
     problem with the data, prior, or fit function.

     Once the fit converges, the best-fit values for the various parameters
     agree well --- that is to within their errors, approximately --- with
     the exact values, which we know since we made the data. For
     example, ``a`` and ``E`` for the first exponential are 0.402(4)
     and 0.9004(5), respectively, from the fit, while the exact answers
     are 0.4 and 0.9; and we get 0.406(14) and 1.803(8) for
     the second exponential where the exact values are 0.4 and 1.8.

   * Note in the fit with ``nexp=4`` how the mean and standard deviation for
     the parameters governing the fourth (and last) exponential are
     identical to the values in the corresponding priors: 0.50(40) from
     the fit for ``a`` and 4.0(4) for ``E``. This tells us that our fit
     data have no information to add to what we knew *a priori*
     about these parameters --- there isn't enough data and what we have
     isn't accurate enough.

     This situation remains true of further terms as they are added in
     the ``nexp=5`` and later fits. This is why the fit results stop
     changing once we have ``nexp=3`` exponentials. There is no point in
     including further exponentials, beyond the need to verify that the fit
     has indeed converged. Note that the underlying function from
     which the data came had 100 |~| exponential terms.

   * The last fit includes ``nexp=6`` exponentials and therefore has 12 |~|
     parameters. This is in a fit to 8 |~| ``y``\s. Old-fashioned fits,
     without
     priors, are impossible when the number of parameters exceeds the number
     of data points. That is clearly not the case here, where the number of
     terms and parameters can be made arbitrarily large, eventually (after
     ``nexp=3`` terms) with no effect at all on the results.

     The reason is that the prior that we include for each new parameter
     is, in effect, a new piece of data (equal to
     the mean and standard deviation of
     the *a priori* expectation for that parameter). Each prior
     leads to a new term
     in the ``chi**2`` function; we are fitting both the data and our *a
     priori* expectations for the parameters. So in the ``nexp=6`` fit,
     for example, we actually have 20 pieces of data to fit: the 8 |~| ``y``\s
     plus the 12 |~| prior values for the 12 |~| parameters.

     That priors are additional fit data becomes obvious if we rewrite
     our fit function as ::

           def g(x, p):         # function used to fit x, y data
               a = p['a']       # array of a[i]s
               E = p['E']       # array of E[i]s
               return dict(
                  y=sum(ai * np.exp(-Ei * x) for ai, Ei in zip(a, E)),
                  a=a,
                  E=E,
                  )

     and add the following right after the loop in the ``main()`` function::

        print('************************************* nexp =', nexp, '(fit g(x,p))')
        data = (x, dict(y=y, a=prior['a'], E=prior['E']))
        gfit = lsqfit.nonlinear_fit(data=data, fcn=g, prior=None, p0=p0)
        print(gfit)
        print()

     This gives exactly the same results as the last fit from the loop, 
     but now with the prior explicitly built into the fit function and data.
     This way of implementing priors, although equivalent, is generally less 
     convenient.

     The effective number of degrees of freedom (``dof`` in the output
     above) is the number of pieces of data minus the number of fit
     parameters, or 20-12=8 in this last case. With priors for every
     parameter, the number of degrees of freedom is always equal to the
     number of ``y``\s, irrespective of how many fit parameters there are.

   * The Gaussian Bayes Factor (whose logarithm is
     ``logGBF`` in the output) is a measure of the likelihood that the actual
     data being fit could have come from a theory with the prior and
     fit function used in the
     fit. The larger this number, the more likely it is that the prior/fit-function
     and data
     could be related. Here it grows dramatically from the first fit
     (``nexp=1``) but then stops changing after ``nexp=3``. The
     implication is that these data are much more likely to have come from a
     theory with ``nexp>=3`` than one with ``nexp=1``.

   * In the code, results for each fit are captured in a Python object
     ``fit``, which is of type :class:`lsqfit.nonlinear_fit`. A summary of the
     fit information is obtained by printing ``fit``. Also the best-fit
     results for each fit parameter can be accessed through ``fit.p``, as is
     done here to calculate various ratios of parameters.

     The errors in these ratios automatically account for any
     correlations in the statistical errors for different parameters. This
     is evident in the ratio ``a1/a0``, which would be 1.010(35) if
     there was no statistical correlation between our estimates for ``a1``
     and ``a0``, but in fact is 1.010(31) in this fit. The modest (positive)
     correlation is clear from the correlation matrix::

      >>> print(gv.evalcorr(fit.p['a'][:2]))
      [[ 1.          0.36353303]
       [ 0.36353303  1.        ]]

   * After the last fit, the code uses function ``gvar.fmt_errorbudget``
     to create an error budget. This requires dictionaries of
     fit inputs and outputs, and uses the dictionary keys to label
     columns and rows, respectively, in the error budget table. The
     table shows, for example, that the 0.43% uncertainty in ``E1/E0``
     comes mostly from the fit data (0.40%), with small contributions
     from the uncertainties in the priors for ``a`` and ``E`` (0.07%
     and 0.12%, respectively). The total uncertainty is the sum in
     quadrature of these errors. This breakdown suggests that reducing the
     errors in ``y`` by 25% might reduce the error in ``E1/E0``
     to around 0.3% (and it does). The uncertainty in ``E2/E0``, on the other
     hand, comes mostly from the priors and is less likely to improve (it
     doesn't).

Finally we inspect the fit's quality point by point. The input data are
compared with results from the fit function, evaluated with the best-fit
parameters, in the following table (obtained in the code by printing the
output from ``fit.format(maxline=True)``\)::

  Fit:
       x[k]               y[k]          f(x[k],p)
  -----------------------------------------------
          5      0.004502 (46)      0.004506 (46)
          6      0.001817 (19)      0.001819 (19)
          7     0.0007362 (79)     0.0007373 (78)
          8     0.0002987 (33)     0.0002993 (32)
          9     0.0001213 (14)     0.0001216 (13)
         10    0.00004926 (57)    0.00004941 (56)
         12       8.13(10)e-06      8.160(96)e-06
         14      1.342(19)e-06      1.348(17)e-06

The fit is excellent over the entire three orders of magnitude. This
information is presented again in the following plot, which shows the ratio
``y/f(x,p)``, as a function of ``x``, using the best-fit parameters ``p``.
The correct result for this ratio, of course, is one. The smooth variation
in the data --- smooth compared with the size of the statistical-error bars
--- is an indication of the statistical correlations between individual
``y``\s.

This particular plot was made using the :mod:`matplotlib` module, with the
following code added to the end of ``main()`` (outside the loop)::

      import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
      ratio = y / f(x, fit.pmean)
      plt.xlim(4, 15)
      plt.ylim(0.95, 1.05)
      plt.xlabel('x')
      plt.ylabel('y / f(x,p)')
      plt.errorbar(x=x, y=gv.mean(ratio), yerr=gv.sdev(ratio), fmt='ob')
      plt.plot([4.0, 21.0], [1.0, 1.0], 'b:')
      plt.show()


Chained Fits; Large Data Sets
-------------------------------
The priors in a fit represent knowledge that we have about the parameters
before we do the fit. This knowledge might come from theoretical
considerations or experiment. Or it might come from another fit. Here we
look at two examples that exploit the possibility of chaining fits, where
the output of one fit is an input (the prior) to another.

Imagine first that we want to add new information to that extracted from the
fit in the previous section. For example, we might learn from some other
source that the ratio of amplitudes ``a[1]/a[0]`` equals 1±1e-5. The challenge
is to combine this new information with information extracted from the fit
above without rerunning that fit. (We assume it is not possible to rerun.)

We can combine the new data with the old fit results by creating a new
fit that uses the best-fit parameters, ``fit.p``, from the old fit as its
prior. To try this out, we modify
the ``main()`` function in the previous section, adding the new fit at the
end::

    def main():
        x, y = make_data()              # collect fit data
        p0 = None                       # make larger fits go faster (opt.)
        for nexp in range(1, 5):
            prior = make_prior(nexp)
            fit = lsqfit.nonlinear_fit(data=(x, y), fcn=fcn, prior=prior, p0=p0)
            if fit.chi2 / fit.dof < 1.:
                p0 = fit.pmean          # starting point for next fit (opt.)

        # print nexp=4 fit results
        print('--------------------- original fit')
        print(fit)
        E = fit.p['E']                  # best-fit parameters
        a = fit.p['a']
        print('E1/E0 =', E[1] / E[0], '  E2/E0 =', E[2] / E[0])
        print('a1/a0 =', a[1] / a[0], '  a2/a0 =', a[2] / a[0])

        # new fit adds new data about a[1] / a[0]
        def ratio(p):                   # new fit function
            a = p['a']
            return a[1] / a[0]

        prior = fit.p                   # prior = best-fit parameters from nexp=4 fit
        data = gv.gvar(1, 1e-5)         # new data for the ratio

        newfit = lsqfit.nonlinear_fit(data=data, fcn=ratio, prior=prior)
        print('\n--------------------- new fit to extra information')
        print(newfit)
        E = newfit.p['E']
        a = newfit.p['a']
        print('E1/E0 =', E[1] / E[0], '  E2/E0 =', E[2] / E[0])
        print('a1/a0 =', a[1] / a[0], '  a2/a0 =', a[2] / a[0])

The results of the new fit (to one piece of new data) are at the end of the
output:

.. literalinclude:: eg1a.out

Parameters ``a[0]`` and ``E[0]`` are essentially unchanged by the new
information, but ``a[1]`` and ``E[1]`` are much more precise,
as is ``a[1]/a[0]``, of course.

It might seem odd that ``E[1]``, for example, is changed at
all, since the fit function, ``ratio(p)``, makes no mention of it. This
is not surprising, however, since ``ratio(p)`` does depend upon ``a[1]``,
and ``a[1]`` is strongly correlated with ``E[1]`` through the prior
(correlation coefficient of |~| 0.94).
It is important to include all parameters from the first fit as
parameters in the new fit, in order to capture the impact of the new
information on parameters correlated with ``a[1]/a[0]``.

Obviously, we can use further fits in order to incorporate additional data. The
prior for each new fit is the best-fit output (``fit.p``) from the previous
fit. The output from the chain's final fit is the cumulative  result of all
of these fits.

Note that this particular problem can be done much more
simply using a weighted average (:func:`lsqfit.wavg`).
Adding the following code
onto the end of the ``main()`` function above ::

    fit.p['a1/a0'] = fit.p['a'][1] / fit.p['a'][0]
    new_data = {'a1/a0' : gv.gvar(1,1e-5)}
    new_p = lsqfit.wavg([fit.p, new_data])

    print('chi2/dof = {:.2f}\n' .format(new_p.chi2 / new_p.dof))
    print('E:', new_p['E'][:4])
    print('a:', new_p['a'][:4])
    print('a1/a0:', new_p['a1/a0'])

gives the following output:

.. literalinclude:: eg1b.out

Here we do a weighted average of ``a[1]/a[0]`` from the
original fit (``fit.p['a1/a0']``) with our new piece of data
(``new_data['a1/a0']``). The dictionary ``new_p`` returned by
:func:`lsqfit.wavg` has an entry for
every key in either ``fit.p`` or ``new_data``. The weighted average for
``a[1]/a[0]`` is in ``new_p['a1/a0']``. New values for the
fit parameters, that take account of the new data, are stored in
``new_p['E']`` and ``new_p['a']``. The ``E[i]`` and ``a[i]``
estimates differ from their values in ``fit.p`` since those parameters
are correlated with ``a[1]/a[0]``. Consequently when the ratio
is shifted by new data, the  ``E[i]`` and ``a[i]`` are shifted as well.
The final results in ``new_p``
are identical to what we obtained above.

One place where chained fits can be useful is when there is lots of fit
data. Imagine, as a second example, a situation that involves 10,000 highly
correlated ``y[i]``\s. A straight fit would take a very long time because
part of the fit process involves diagonalizing the fit data's (dense)
10,000 |x|\10,000 covariance matrix. Instead we break the data up into
batches of |~| 100 and do chained fits of one batch after another::

    # read data from disk
    x, y = read_data()
    print('x = [{}  {} ... {}]'.format(x[0], x[1], x[-1]))
    print('y = [{}  {} ... {}]'.format(y[0], y[1], y[-1]))
    print('corr(y[0],y[9999]) =', gv.evalcorr([y[0], y[-1]])[1,0])
    print()

    # fit function and prior
    def fcn(x, p):
        return p[0] + p[1] * np.exp(- p[2] * x)
    prior = gv.gvar(['0(1)', '0(1)', '0(1)'])

    # Nstride fits, each to nfit data points
    nfit = 100
    Nstride = len(y) // nfit
    fit_time = 0.0
    for n in range(0, Nstride):
        fit = lsqfit.nonlinear_fit(
            data=(x[n::Nstride], y[n::Nstride]), prior=prior, fcn=fcn
            )
        prior = fit.p
        if n in [0, 9]:
            print('******* Results from ', (n+1) * nfit, 'data points')
            print(fit)
    print('******* Results from ', Nstride * nfit, 'data points (final)')
    print(fit)

In the loop, we fit only 100 data points at a time, but the prior we use is
the best-fit result from the fit to the previous 100 data points,
and its prior comes from fitting the 100 points before those, and so on
for 100 |~| fits in all.
The output from this code is:

.. literalinclude:: eg9a.out

It shows the errors on ``p[1]`` and ``p[2]`` decreasing steadily as more
data points are included. The error on ``p[0]``, however, hardly changes
at all. This is a consequence of the strong correlation between different
``y[i]``\s (and its lack of x-dependence).
The "correct" answers here are 0.5, 0.4 and |~| 0.7.

Chained fits are slower that straight fits with large amounts of
*uncorrelated* data, provided |nonlinear_fit| is informed ahead of
time that the data are uncorrelated (by default it checks for
correlations, which can be expensive for lots of data).
The fitter is informed by using argument
``udata`` instead of ``data`` to specify the fit data::

    x, y = read_data()
    print('x = [{}  {} ... {}]'.format(x[0], x[1], x[-1]))
    print('y = [{}  {} ... {}]'.format(y[0], y[1], y[-1]))
    print()

    # fit function and prior
    def fcn(x, p):
        return p[0] + p[1] * np.exp(- p[2] * x)
    prior = gv.gvar(['0(1)', '0(1)', '0(1)'])

    fit = lsqfit.nonlinear_fit(udata=(x, y), prior=prior, fcn=fcn)
    print(fit)

Using ``udata`` rather than ``data`` causes |nonlinear_fit| to
ignore correlations in the data, whether they exist or not.
Uncorrelated fits are typically
much faster when fitting large amounts of data, so it is then
possible to fit much more data
(e.g., 1,000,000 or more ``y[i]``\s is straightforward on a laptop).


``x`` has Errors
------------------
We now consider variations on our basic fit analysis (described in
:ref:`basic-fits`).
The first variation concerns what to do when the independent variables, the
``x``\s, have errors, as well as the ``y``\s. This is easily handled by
turning the ``x``\s into fit parameters, and otherwise dispensing
with independent variables.

To illustrate, consider the data assembled by the following ``make_data``
function::

  import gvar as gv

  def make_data():
      x = gv.gvar([
          '0.73(50)',   '2.25(50)',  '3.07(50)',  '3.62(50)',  '4.86(50)',
          '6.41(50)',   '6.39(50)',  '7.89(50)',  '9.32(50)',  '9.78(50)',
          '10.83(50)', '11.98(50)', '13.37(50)', '13.84(50)', '14.89(50)'
          ])
      y = gv.gvar([
           '3.85(70)',  '5.5(1.7)',  '14.0(2.6)',   '21.8(3.4)',   '47.0(5.2)',
          '79.8(4.6)', '84.9(4.6)',  '95.2(2.2)',   '97.65(79)',   '98.78(55)',
          '99.41(25)', '99.80(12)', '100.127(77)', '100.202(73)', '100.203(71)'
          ])
      return x,y

The function call ``x,y = make_data()`` returns values for the ``x[i]``\s and
the corresponding ``y[i]``\s, where now both are |GVar|\s.

We want to fit the ``y`` values with a function of the form::

  b0 / ((1 + gv.exp(b1 - b2 * x)) ** (1. / b3)).

So we have two sets of parameters for which we need priors: the ``b[i]``\s and
the ``x[i]``\s::

  import gvar as gv

  def make_prior(x):
      prior = gv.BufferDict()
      prior['b'] = gv.gvar(['0(500)', '0(5)', '0(5)', '0(5)'])
      prior['x'] = x
      return prior

The prior values for the ``x[i]`` are just the values returned by
``make_data()``. The corresponding fit function is::

  import gvar as gv

  def fcn(p):
      b0, b1, b2, b3 = p['b']
      x = p['x']
      return b0 / ((1. + gv.exp(b1 - b2 * x)) ** (1. / b3))

where the dependent variables ``x[i]`` are no longer arguments
of the function,
but rather are fit parameter in dictionary |~| ``p``.

The actual fit is now straightforward::

  import lsqfit

  x, y = make_data()
  prior = make_prior(x)
  fit = lsqfit.nonlinear_fit(prior=prior, data=y, fcn=fcn)
  print(fit)

This generates the following output:

.. literalinclude:: eg2.out

The fit gives new results for the ``b[i]`` parameters that are much
improved from our prior estimates. Results for many of the ``x[i]``\s
are improved as well, by information from the fit data. The following
plot shows the fit (dashed line) compared with the input data for |~| ``y``:

.. _correlated-parameters:

Correlated Parameters; Gaussian Bayes Factor
---------------------------------------------
:class:`gvar.GVar` objects allow for complicated priors, including
priors that correlate different fit parameters.
The following fit analysis code illustrates
how this is done::

  import numpy as np
  import gvar as gv
  import lsqfit

  def main():
      x, y = make_data()
      prior = make_prior()
      fit = lsqfit.nonlinear_fit(prior=prior, data=(x,y), fcn=fcn)
      print(fit)
      print('p1/p0 =', fit.p[1] / fit.p[0], 'p3/p2 =', fit.p[3] / fit.p[2])
      print('corr(p0,p1) =', gv.evalcorr(fit.p[:2])[1,0])

  def make_data():
      x = np.array([
          4., 2., 1., 0.5, 0.25, 0.167, 0.125, 0.1, 0.0833, 0.0714, 0.0625
          ])
      y = gv.gvar([
          '0.198(14)', '0.216(15)', '0.184(23)', '0.156(44)', '0.099(49)',
          '0.142(40)', '0.108(32)', '0.065(26)', '0.044(22)', '0.041(19)',
          '0.044(16)'
          ])
      return x, y

  def make_prior():
      p = gv.gvar(['0(1)', '0(1)', '0(1)', '0(1)'])
      p[1] = 20 * p[0] + gv.gvar('0.0(1)')        # p[1] correlated with p[0]
      return p

  def fcn(x, p):
      return (p[0] * (x**2 + p[1] * x)) / (x**2 + x * p[2] + p[3])

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()

Here, again, functions ``make_data()`` and ``make_prior()`` assemble the
fit data and prior, and parameters ``p[i]`` are adjusted by the fitter
to make ``fcn(x[i], p)`` agree with the data value |~| ``y[i]``. The priors
are fairly broad (0±1) for all of the parameters, except for
``p[1]``. The prior introduces a tight relationship between ``p[1]``
and ``p[0]``:  it sets ``p[1]=20*p[0]`` up to corrections of
order |~| 0±0.1. This *a priori* relationship is built into the prior
and restricts the fit.

Running the code gives the following output:

.. literalinclude:: eg3a.out

Note how the ratio ``p1/p0`` is much more accurate than either quantity
separately. The prior introduces a strong, positive correlation between
the two parameters that
survives the fit: the correlation coefficient is |~| 0.96. Comparing the
fit function with the best-fit parameters (dashed line)
with the data shows a good fit:

.. image:: eg3.png
   :width: 70%


If we omit the constraint in the prior, ::

  def make_prior():
      p = gv.gvar(['0(1)', '0(20)', '0(1)', '0(1)'])
      return p

we obtain quite different fit results:

.. literalinclude:: eg3b.out

Note that the Gaussian Bayes Factor (see ``logGBF`` in the output) is
larger with the correlated prior (``logGBF = 19.1``) than it
was for the uncorrelated prior (``logGBF = 11.0``). Had we been
uncertain as to which prior was more appropriate, this difference says that
the data prefers the correlated prior. (More precisely, it says that we
would be ``exp(19.1-11.0) = 3300`` |~| times more likely to get
our ``x,y`` data
from a theory with the
correlated prior than from one with the uncorrelated prior.) This
difference is significant despite the fact that the ``chi**2`` is
lower for the uncorrelated case. ``chi**2`` tests goodness of fit,
but there are
usually more ways than one to get a good fit. Some are more plausible
than others, and the Bayes Factor helps sort out which.

The Gaussian Bayes Factor is an approximation to
the Bayes Factor which is valid in the limit where
all distributions can be approximated by Gaussians. The Bayes Factor
is the probability
(density) that the fit data would be generated randomly from the
fit function and priors (the *model*) used in the fit.
Ratios of Bayes Factors from fits with different models tell us about the
relative likelihood of the different models given the data. (Actually the
ratio gives the ratio of probabilities for obtaining the data
from the models, as opposed to the probabilities for the models given
the data. See the discussion below.)


``y`` has No Error; Marginalization
--------------------------------------
Occasionally there are fit problems where values for the dependent
variable ``y`` are known exactly (to machine precision). This poses a
problem for least-squares fitting since the ``chi**2`` function is
infinite when standard deviations are zero. How does one assign errors
to exact ``y``\s in order to define a ``chi**2`` function that can be
usefully minimized?

It is almost always the case in physical applications of this sort that the
fit function has in principle an infinite number of parameters. It is, of
course, impossible to extract information about infinitely many parameters
from a finite number of ``y``\s. In practice, however, we generally care about
only a few of the parameters in the fit function.
The goal for a least-squares fit is to figure out what a finite
number of exact ``y``\s can tell us about the parameters we want to know.

The key idea here is to use priors to model the part of the fit function
that we don't care about, and to remove that part of the function from
the analysis by subtracting it out from the input data. This is called
*marginalization*.

To illustrate how it is done,
we consider data that is generated from
an infinite sum of decaying exponentials, like that in :ref:`basic-fits`::

  import numpy as np

    def make_data():
        x = np.array([ 1., 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2., 2.2, 2.4, 2.6])
        y = np.array([
            0.2740471001620033,  0.2056894154005132,  0.158389402324004,
            0.1241967645280511,  0.0986901274726867,  0.0792134506060024,
            0.0640743982173861,  0.052143504367789 ,  0.0426383022456816,
            ])
        return x, y

Now ``x,y = make_data()`` returns nine ``x[i]``\s together with the
corresponding ``y[i]``\s, but where the ``y[i]``\s are exact and so
no longer represented by |~| |GVar|\s.

We want to fit these data
with a sum of exponentials, as before::

  import numpy as np

  def fcn(x,p):
      a = p['a']       # array of a[i]s
      E = p['E']       # array of E[i]s
      return np.sum(ai * np.exp(-Ei*x) for ai, Ei in zip(a, E))

We know that the amplitudes ``a[i]`` are of order 0.5±0.5, and
that the leading exponent ``E[0]`` is 1±0.1, as are the differences
between subsequent exponents ``dE[i] = E[i] - E[i-1]``. This *a priori*
knowledge is encoded in the priors::

  import numpy as np
  import gvar as gv

  def make_prior(nexp):
      prior = gv.BufferDict()
      prior['a'] = gv.gvar(nexp * ['0.5(5)'])
      dE = gv.gvar(nexp * ['1.0(1)'])
      prior['E'] = np.cumsum(dE)
      return prior

We use a large number of exponential terms since
our ``y[i]``\s are exact: we keep 100 |~| terms in all,
but our results are unchanged
with any number greater than about |~| 10. Only a small number ``nexp``
of these are included in the fit function. The ``100-nexp`` terms left out
are subtracted from the ``y[i]`` before the fit, using
the prior values for the omitted parameters to evaluate these terms.
This gives
new fit data ``ymod[i]``::

  prior = make_prior(100)

  # the first nexp terms are fit; the remainder go into ymod
  fit_prior = gv.BufferDict()
  ymod_prior = gv.BufferDict()
  for k in prior:
      fit_prior[k] = prior[:nexp]
      ymod_prior[k] = prior[nexp:]

  ymod = y - fcn(x, ymod_prior)
  fit = lsqfit.nonlinear_fit(data=(x, ymod), prior=fit_prior, fcn=fcn)

By subtracting ``fcn(x, ymod_prior)`` from ``y``, we remove the parameters
that are in ``ymod_prior`` from the data, and consequently those parameters
need not be included in fit function. The fitter uses only
the parameters left in ``fit_prior``.

Our complete code, therefore, is::

    import numpy as np
    import gvar as gv
    import lsqfit

    def main():
        x, y = make_data()
        prior = make_prior(100)             # 100 exponential terms in all
        p0 = None
        for nexp in range(1, 6):
            # marginalize the last 100 - nexp terms (in ymod_prior)
            fit_prior = gv.BufferDict()     # part of prior used in fit
            ymod_prior = gv.BufferDict()    # part of prior absorbed in ymod
            for k in prior:
                fit_prior[k] = prior[k][:nexp]
                ymod_prior[k] = prior[k][nexp:]
            ymod = y - fcn(x, ymod_prior)   # remove temrs in ymod_prior

            # fit modified data with just nexp terms (in fit_prior)
            fit = lsqfit.nonlinear_fit(
                data=(x, ymod), prior=fit_prior, fcn=fcn, p0=p0, tol=1e-10,
                )

            # print fit information
            print('************************************* nexp =',nexp)
            print(fit.format(True))
            p0 = fit.pmean

        # print summary information and error budget
        E = fit.p['E']                      # best-fit parameters
        a = fit.p['a']
        outputs = {
            'E1/E0':E[1] / E[0], 'E2/E0':E[2] / E[0],
            'a1/a0':a[1] / a[0], 'a2/a0':a[2] / a[0]
            }
        inputs = {
            'E prior':prior['E'], 'a prior':prior['a'],
            'svd cut':fit.correction,
            }
        print(gv.fmt_values(outputs))
        print(gv.fmt_errorbudget(outputs, inputs))

    def fcn(x,p):
        a = p['a']       # array of a[i]s
        E = p['E']       # array of E[i]s
        return np.sum(ai * np.exp(-Ei*x) for ai, Ei in zip(a, E))

    def make_prior(nexp):
        prior = gv.BufferDict()
        prior['a'] = gv.gvar(nexp * ['0.5(5)'])
        dE = gv.gvar(nexp * ['1.0(1)'])
        prior['E'] = np.cumsum(dE)
        return prior

    def make_data():
        x = np.array([ 1., 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2., 2.2, 2.4, 2.6])
        y = np.array([
            0.2740471001620033,  0.2056894154005132,  0.158389402324004 ,
            0.1241967645280511,  0.0986901274726867,  0.0792134506060024,
            0.0640743982173861,  0.052143504367789 ,  0.0426383022456816,
            ])
        return x, y

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()

We loop over ``nexp``, moving parameters from ``ymod`` back into the fit
as ``nexp`` increases. The output from this script is:

.. literalinclude:: eg5a.out

Here we use ``fit.format(True)`` to print out a table of ``x`` and
``y`` (actually ``ymod``) values, together with the value of the
fit function using the best-fit parameters. There are several things
to notice:

  * Even the ``nexp=1`` fit, where we fit the data with just a single
    exponential, gives results for the two parameters
    that are accurate to 1% or better. The results don't change much
    as further terms are shifted from ``ymod`` to the fit function,
    and stop changing completely by ``nexp=4``.

    In fact it is straightforward to prove that best-fit parameter means
    and standard deviations, as well as ``chi**2``, should be exactly the
    same in such situations provided the fit function is linear in all fit
    parameters. Here the fit function is approximately linear, given our
    small standard deviations, and so results are only approximately
    independent of ``nexp``.

  * ``ymod`` has large
    uncertainties when ``nexp`` is small, because of the uncertainties
    in the priors used to evaluate ``fcn(x, ymod_prior)``. This
    is clear from the following plots:

    .. image:: eg5.png
        :width: 80%

    The solid lines in these plot show the exact results, from ``y`` in the
    code. The dashed lines show the fit function with the best-fit parameters
    for the ``nexp`` terms used in each fit, and the data points show ``ymod``
    --- these last two agree well, as expected from the excellent
    ``chi**2`` values.
    The uncertainties in different ``ymod[i]``\s are highly correlated
    with each other
    because they come from the same priors (in ``ymod_prior``). These
    correlations are evident in the plots and are essential to this
    procedure.

  * Although we motivated this example by the need to deal with ``y``\s
    having no errors, it is straightforward to apply the same ideas to
    a situation where the ``y``\s have errors. Often in a fit we are
    interested in only one or two of many fit parameters. Getting rid
    of the uninteresting parameters (by absorbing them into ``ymod``)
    can greatly reduce the number of parameters varied by the fit,
    thereby speeding up the fit. Here we are in effect doing a
    100-exponential fit to our data, but actually fitting with only
    a handful of parameters (only |~| 2 for ``nexp=1``). The parameters 
    removed in this way are said to be *marginalized*.

SVD Cuts and Roundoff Error
-----------------------------
All of the fits discussed above have (default) SVD cuts of 1e-12. This
has little impact in most of the problems, but makes a big difference
in the problem discussed in the previous section. Had we run that fit,
for example, with an SVD cut of 1e-19, instead of 1e-12, we would have
obtained the following output:

.. literalinclude:: eg5b.out

The standard deviations quoted for ``E1/E0``, *etc.* are much too large
compared with the standard deviations than what we obtained
in the previous section.
This is due to roundoff error. The strong correlations between the
different data points (``ymod[i]`` --- see the previous section) in this
analysis result
in a data covariance matrix that is too ill-conditioned without an SVD cut.

The inverse of the data's covariance matrix is used in the ``chi**2``
function that is minimized by :class:`lsqfit.nonlinear_fit`. Given the
finite precision of computer hardware, it is impossible to compute this
inverse accurately if the matrix is almost singular, and in
such situations the reliability of the fit results is in question. The
eigenvalues of the covariance matrix in this example (for ``nexp=5``)
cover a range of about 18 |~| orders of magnitude --- too large
to be handled in normal double precision computation.
The smallest eigenvalues and their
eigenvectors are likely to be quite inaccurate.

A standard solution to this common problem in least-squares fitting is
to introduce an SVD cut, here called ``svdcut``::

   fit = nonlinear_fit(data=(x, ymod), fcn=f, prior=prior, p0=p0, svdcut=1e-12)

This regulates the singularity of the covariance matrix by
replacing its smallest eigenvalues with a larger, minimum
eigenvalue. The cost is less precision in the final results
since we are decreasing the
precision of the input ``y`` data. This is a conservative move, but numerical
stability is worth the trade off. The listing shows that 3 |~| eigenvalues are
modified when ``svdcut=1e-12`` (see entry for ``svdcut/n``); no
eigenvalues are changed when ``svdcut=1e-19``.

The SVD cut is actually applied to the correlation matrix, which is the
covariance matrix rescaled by standard deviations so that  all diagonal
elements equal 1. Working with the correlation matrix rather than the
covariance matrix helps mitigate problems caused by large scale differences
between different variables. Eigenvalues of the correlation matrix that are
smaller than a minimum eigenvalue, equal to ``svdcut`` times the largest
eigenvalue,  are replaced by the minimum eigenvalue, while leaving their
eigenvectors unchanged. This defines a new, less singular correlation matrix
from which a new, less singular covariance matrix is constructed. Larger
values of ``svdcut`` affect larger numbers of eigenmodes and increase errors
in the final results.

The results shown in the previous section include an error budget, and it
has an entry for the error introduced by the (default) SVD cut (obtained
from ``fit.correction``).
The contribution is negligible. It is zero when ``svdcut=1e-19``, of course,
but the instability caused by the ill-conditioned covariance matrix in
that case makes it unacceptable.

The SVD cut is applied separately to each block diagonal sub-matrix of the
correlation matrix. This means, among other things, that errors for
uncorrelated data are unaffected by the SVD cut. Applying an SVD
cut of 1e-4, for example, to the following singular covariance matrix, ::

  [[  1.0   1.0   0.0  ]
   [  1.0   1.0   0.0  ]
   [  0.0   0.0   1e-20]],

gives a new, non-singular matrix ::

  [[  1.0001   0.9999   0.0  ]
   [  0.9999   1.0001   0.0  ]
   [  0.0      0.0      1e-20]]

where only the upper left sub-matrix is different.

:class:`lsqfit.nonlinear_fit` uses a default value for ``svdcut`` of 1e-12.
This default can be overridden, as shown above, but for many
problems it is a good choice. Roundoff errors become more accute, however,
when there are strong correlations between different parts of the fit
data or prior.  Then much larger ``svdcut``\s may be needed.

The SVD cut is applied to both the data and the prior. It is possible to
apply SVD cuts to either of these separately using :func:`gvar.regulate` before
the fit: for example, ::

  y = gv.regulate(ymod, svdcut=1e-10)
  prior = gv.regulate(prior, svdcut=1e-12)
  fit = nonlinear_fit(data=(x, y), fcn=f, prior=prior, svdcut=None)

applies different SVD cuts to the prior and data.

Note that taking ``svdcut=-1e-12``, with a
minus sign, causes the problematic modes to be dropped. This is a more
conventional implementation of SVD cuts, but here it results in much less
precision than using ``svdcut=1e-12`` (giving, for example, 2.094(94)
for ``E1/E0``, which is almost five times less precise). Dropping modes is
equivalent to setting the corresponding variances to infinity, which is
(obviously) much more conservative and less realistic than setting them equal
to the SVD-cutoff variance.

The method :func:`lsqfit.nonlinear_fit.check_roundoff` can be used to check
for roundoff errors by adding the line ``fit.check_roundoff()`` after the
fit. It generates a warning if roundoff looks to be a problem. This check
is done automatically if ``debug=True`` is added to the argument list of
:class:`lsqfit.nonlinear_fit`.

.. _svd-cuts-statistics:

SVD Cuts and Inadequate Statistics
-----------------------------------
Roundoff error is one reason to use SVD cuts. Another is inadequate
statistics. Consider the following example, which seeks to fit
data obtained by averaging ``N=5`` random samples (a very small
number of samples)::

  import numpy as np
  import gvar as gv
  import lsqfit

  def main():
      ysamples = [
          [0.0092441016, 0.0068974057, 0.0051480509, 0.0038431422, 0.0028690492], 
          [0.0092477405, 0.0069030565, 0.0051531383, 0.0038455855, 0.0028700587], 
          [0.0092558569, 0.0069102437, 0.0051596569, 0.0038514537, 0.0028749153], 
          [0.0092294581, 0.0068865156, 0.0051395262, 0.003835656, 0.0028630454], 
          [0.009240534, 0.0068961523, 0.0051480046, 0.0038424661, 0.0028675632],
          ]
      y = gv.dataset.avg_data(ysamples)
      x = np.array([15., 16., 17., 18., 19.])
      def fcn(p):
          return p['a'] * gv.exp(- p['b'] * x)
      prior = dict(a='0.75(5)', b='0.30(3)')
      fit = lsqfit.nonlinear_fit(data=y, prior=prior, fcn=fcn, svdcut=0.0)
      print(fit.format(True))

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()

This gives a terrible fit:

.. literalinclude:: eg10a.out

The problem is that the small eigenvalues of the fit data's correlation
matrix are badly underestimated when we have only a small number of samples
(compared with the number of data points being fit). Indeed the smallest
eigenvalues vanish (exactly) when the number of samples is smaller
than the number of data points.

An SVD cut is needed. We use :func:`gvar.dataset.svd_analysis` to estimate
the appropriate size of the cut (by means of a bootstrap simulation that
identifies
the eigenmodes of the correlation matrix  that are poorly estimated from
our data sample). To use it we replace the line ::

  y = gv.dataset.avg_data(ysamples)

in the code by ::

  s = gv.dataset.svd_diagnosis(ysamples)
  y = s.avgdata

and set ``svdcut=s.svdcut`` in the call to the fitter. The result is
the following (excellent) fit:

.. literalinclude:: eg10b.out

The SVD cut is set to ``0.0028`` here and modifies 3 of the 5 eigenmodes in the
correlation matrix. Generally one needs an SVD cut unless there
are many more samples than data points — 10 or 100 times as many. 

See the discussions in :ref:`goodness-of-fit` and :ref:`fit-residuals` for further 
analysis of this example.

:class:`lsqfit.nonlinear_fit` will apply an SVD cut if keyword parameter
``svdcut`` is set. Another way to implement SVD cuts is using
:meth:`gvar.regulate` to modify the fit data before it is fit.


``y`` has Unknown Errors
-------------------------
There are situations where the input data ``y`` is known to have
uncertainties, but where we do not know how big those uncertainties are.
A common approach is to infer these uncertainties from the fluctuations
of the data around the best-fit result.

As an example, consider the following data::

  x = np.array([1., 2., 3., 4.])
  y = np.array([3.4422, 1.2929, 0.4798, 0.1725])

We want to fit these data with a simple exponential::

  p[0] * gv.exp( - p[1] * x)

where from we know *a priori* that ``p[0]`` is |~| 10±1 and
``p[1]`` is |~| 1±0.1. We assume that the relative uncertainty in
``y`` is ``x``-independent and uncorrelated.

Our strategy is to introduce a relative error for the data and to vary
its size to maximize the ``logGBF`` that results from a fit to our
exponential. The choice that maximizes the
Bayes Factor is the one that is favored by the data. This procedure
is called the *Empirical Bayes* method.

This method is implemented in a driver program ::

    fit, z = lsqfit.empbayes_fit(z0, fitargs)

which varies parameter ``z``, starting at ``z0``, to maximize
``fit.logGBF`` where ::

    fit = lsqfit.nonlinear_fit(**fitargs(z)).

Function ``fitargs(z)`` returns a dictionary containing the arguments for
:class:`lsqfit.nonlinear_fit`. These arguments are
varied as functions of ``z``. The optimal fit (that is, the one for which
``fit.logGBF`` is maximum) and ``z`` are returned.

Here we want to vary the relative error assigned to the data values,
so we use the following code, where the uncertainty in ``y[i]`` is set
equal to ``dy[i] = y[i] * z``::

    import numpy as np
    import gvar as gv
    import lsqfit

    # fit data and prior
    x = np.array([1., 2., 3., 4.])
    y = np.array([3.4422, 1.2929, 0.4798, 0.1725])
    prior = gv.gvar(['10(1)', '1.0(1)'])

    # fit function
    def fcn(x, p):
        return p[0] * gv.exp(-p[1] * x)

    # find optimal dy
    def fitargs(z):
        dy = y * z
        newy = gv.gvar(y, dy)
        return dict(data=(x, newy), fcn=fcn, prior=prior)

    fit, z = lsqfit.empbayes_fit(0.001, fitargs)
    print(fit.format(True))

This code produces the following output:

.. literalinclude:: eg7a.out

The variation in the data suggests a relative error of about 1.6%
for the input data. The overall fit is excellent.

It is important to appreciate that the outcome of a such a fit depends
in detail on the assumptions you make about ``y``'s uncertainties |~| ``dy``.
We assume ``dy/y`` is ``x``-independent above, but we get a somewhat different
answer if instead we assume that ``dy`` is constant. Then ``fitrargs``
becomes ::

    def fitargs(z):
        dy =  np.ones_like(y) * z
        newy = gv.gvar(y, dy)
        return dict(data=(x, newy), fcn=fcn, prior=prior)

and the output is:

.. literalinclude:: eg7b.out

The data suggest an uncertainty of 0.0066 in each ``y[i]``.
Results for the fit parameters ``fit.p[i]`` are similar in the two cases,
but the error on ``p[0]`` is almost four times smaller with
constant |~| ``dy``.

There is no way to tell from the data which of these error scenarios for
|~| ``y`` is correct. ``logGBF`` is slightly larger for the second fit,
despite its larger ``chi2/dof``, but the difference is not significant.
There isn't enough data and it doesn't cover a large enough range to
distinguish between these two options. Additional information about
the data or data taking is needed to decide.

The Empirical Bayes method for setting ``dy`` becomes trivial when there
are no priors and when ``dy`` is assumed to be ``x``-independent. Then it is
possible to minimize the *chi**2* function without knowing ``dy``, since
``dy`` factors out. The
optimal ``dy`` is just the standard deviation of the fit residuals
``y[i] - fcn(x[i],p)`` with the best-fit parameters |~| ``p``. This
assumption is implicit in many fit routines that fit
data without errors (and without priors).


.. _empirical-bayes:

Tuning Priors with the Empirical Bayes Criterion
------------------------------------------------
Given two choices of prior for a parameter, the one that results in a larger
Gaussian Bayes Factor after fitting (see ``logGBF`` in fit output or
``fit.logGBF``) is the one preferred by the data. We can use this fact to tune
a prior or set of priors in situations where we are uncertain about the
correct *a priori* value: we vary the widths and/or central values of the
priors of interest to maximize ``logGBF``. In effect
we are using the data to get a feel for what is a reasonable prior. This
procedure for setting priors is again, as in the previous section,
an example of the Empirical Bayes method and can be implemented using
function :func:`lsqfit.empbayes_fit`.

The following code illustrates how this is done::

    import numpy as np
    import gvar as gv
    import lsqfit

    x = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7])
    y = np.array([
        '0.133426(95)', '0.20525(15)', '0.27491(20)', '0.32521(25)',
        '0.34223(28)', '0.32394(28)', '0.27857(27)'
        ])

    def fcn(x, p):
        return gv.exp(-p[0] - p[1] * x - p[2] * x**2 - p[3] * x**3)

    def fitargs(z):
        dp = z
        prior = gv.gvar([gv.gvar(0, dp) for i in range(4)])
        return dict(prior=prior, fcn=fcn, data=(x,y))

    fit,z = lsqfit.empbayes_fit(1.0, fitargs)
    print(fit.format(True))

Here the fitter varies parameters ``p`` until ``fcn(x,p)`` equals the
input data ``y``. We don't know *a priori* how large the coefficients
``p[i]`` are. In ``fitargs`` we assume they are all of order
``dp = z``. Function ``empbayes_fit`` varies ``z`` to maximize
|~| ``fit.logGBF``. The output is as follows:

.. literalinclude:: eg4a.out

The data suggest that the coefficients are of order 0±5.3.
The actual values of the parameters are, of course,
consistent with the Empirical Bayes estimate.

The Bayes factor, ``exp(fit.logGBF)``, is useful for deciding about
fit functions as well as priors. If we repeat the analysis above
but with the following data ::

    x = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7])
    y = np.array([
        '0.133213(95)', '0.20245(15)', '0.26282(19)', '0.29099(22)',
        '0.27589(22)', '0.22328(19)', '0.15436(14)'
        ])

we find that fits with 3 or 4 |~| ``p[i]``\s give the following results:

.. literalinclude:: eg4b.out

The two fits are almost equally good, giving almost the same ``chi**2``
values. The first fit, with only 3 |~| ``p[i]``\s, however, has a
significantly larger ``logGBF``. This indicates that this data is
``exp(27.1-22.6) = 90`` times more likely to come from the theory with
only 3 |~| ``p[i]``\s than from the one with |~| 4. The data much prefer
the 3-parameter theory, and they do, as it turns out,
come from such a theory. Note that the value for ``p[3]`` in
the second case is consistent with zero, but the errors on the other
parameters are much larger if it is included in the fit.

The Empirical Bayes procedure can be abused, because it is possible to make
``logGBF`` arbitrarily large. For example, setting ::

    prior = gv.gvar([
        '2.5904 +- 2.6e-16', '-6.53012 +- 6.5e-16',
        '7.83211 +- 7.8e-16', '-1.68813 +- 1.7e-16',
        ])

in the problem above and then fitting gives ``logGBF=52.2``,  which is much
larger than the  alternatives above. This "prior" is ridiculous, however: it
has means equal to the best-fit results with standard deviations that are  16
|~| orders of magnitude smaller. This is the kind of prior you  get from
Empirical Bayes if you vary the means and standard deviations of all
parameters independently.

Bayes Theorem explains what is wrong with such priors. The Bayes Factor is
proportional to the probability ``P(y|model)``  that the fit data would arise
given the model (priors plus fit function). When selecting models, we really
want to maximize ``P(model|y)``, the probability of the model given the data.
These two probabilities are different, but are related by Bayes Theorem:
``P(model|y)`` is proportional to ``P(y|model)`` times ``P(model)``, where
``P(model)`` is the *a priori* probability of the model being correct. When we
choose a model by maximizing ``logGBF`` (that is, by
maximizing ``P(y|model)``),
we are implicitly assuming that the
various models we are considering are all equally likely candidates --- that
is, we are assuming that ``P(model)`` is approximately constant across the
model space we are exploring. The *a priori* probability for the ridiculous
prior just
above is vanishingly small,
and so comparing its ``logGBF`` to
the others is nonsensical.

Note that :func:`empbayes_fit` allows ``fitargs(z)`` to return
a dictionary of arguments for the fitter together with a ``plausibility``
for |~| ``z``, which corresponds to ``log(P(model))`` in the discussion
above. This allows you steer the search away from completely
implausible solutions.

Empirical Bayes tends to be most useful when varying the width of the prior for
a single parameter,  or varying the widths of a group of parameters together.
It is also useful for validating (rather than setting) the choice of a
prior or set of priors for a fit, by comparing the optimal choice (according
to the data) with choice actually used.

.. _positive-parameters:

Positive Parameters; Non-Gaussian Priors
----------------------------------------
The priors for |nonlinear_fit| are all Gaussian. There are situations,
however, where other distributions would be desirable. One such case is where
a parameter is known to be positive, but is close to zero in value ("close"
being defined relative to the *a priori* uncertainty). For such cases we would
like to use  non-Gaussian priors that force positivity --- for example, priors
that  impose log-normal or exponential distributions on the parameter.
Ideally the decision to use such a distribution is made on a parameter-
by-parameter basis, when creating the priors, and has no impact on the
definition of the fit function itself.

|nonlinear_fit| supports log-normal distributions among others. This
functionality is implemented through the :class:`gvar.BufferDict` dictionary
class, which is the standard dictionary used by :mod:`lsqfit` internally and
for results. See the :class:`gvar.BufferDict` documentation for more
information.

The prior for a parameter ``'a'``, for example, is switched from
a Gaussian distribution to a log-normal distribution by replacing
``prior['a']`` in the fit prior with a prior for its logarithm,
``prior['log(a)']``. This causes |nonlinear_fit| to use the logarithm as the
fit parameter (with its Gaussian prior). Fit parameters are stored in a
|BufferDict| ``p``, which returns values for ``p['log(a)']``, as expected, but
also for ``p['a']``, where the latter is automatically set equal to the
exponential of the former. Consequently only the prior need be changed to
switch distributions. In particular the fit function can be expressed directly
in terms of fit parameter ``p['a']``, so that it is independent of the
distribution chosen for the ``'a'`` prior.

To illustrate consider a simple problem where an experimental quantity ``y`` is
known to be positive, but experimental errors mean that measured values can
often be negative::

    import gvar as gv
    import lsqfit

    y = gv.gvar([
        '-0.17(20)', '-0.03(20)', '-0.39(20)', '0.10(20)', '-0.03(20)',
        '0.06(20)', '-0.23(20)', '-0.23(20)', '-0.15(20)', '-0.01(20)',
        '-0.12(20)', '0.05(20)', '-0.09(20)', '-0.36(20)', '0.09(20)',
        '-0.07(20)', '-0.31(20)', '0.12(20)', '0.11(20)', '0.13(20)'
        ])

We want to know the average value ``a`` of the ``y``\s and so could
use the following fitting code::

   prior = {'a':gv.gvar('0.02(2)')}               # a = average of y's

   def fcn(p, N=len(y)):
      return N * [p['a']]

   fit = lsqfit.nonlinear_fit(prior=prior, data=y, fcn=fcn)
   print(fit)
   print('a =', fit.p['a'])

where we are assuming *a priori* information that suggests
the average is around 0.02. The output from this code is:

.. literalinclude:: eg6-a.out

This is not such a useful result since much of the one-sigma range for ``a``
is negative, and yet we know that ``a`` must be postive.

A better analysis uses a log-normal distribution for ``a``::

   prior = {}
   prior['log(a)'] = gv.log(gv.gvar('0.02(2)'))   # log(a) not a

   def fcn(p, N=len(y)):
      return N * [p['a']]

   fit = lsqfit.nonlinear_fit(prior=prior, data=y, fcn=fcn)
   print(fit)
   print('a =', fit.p['a'])                       # exp(log(a))

The fit parameter is now ``log(a)`` rather than ``a`` itself, but the code
is unchanged except for the definition of the prior. In particular the
fit function is identical to what we used in the first case since
parameter dictionary ``p`` returns values for both ``'a'`` and ``'log(a)'``.

The result from this fit is

.. literalinclude:: eg6-log_a.out

which is more compelling. Parameters listed  above the dashed line in the
parameter table are the actual  parameters used in the fit; those listed below
the dashed line are derived from those above the line. The "correct" value for
``a`` here is 0.015 (given the method used to generate the ``y``\s).

Other distributions are available. For example, the code ::

   prior = {}
   prior['f(a)'] = gv.BufferDict.uniform('f', 0, 0.04)

   def fcn(p, N=len(y)):
      return N * [p['a']]

   fit = lsqfit.nonlinear_fit(prior=prior, data=y, fcn=fcn)
   print(fit)
   print('a =', fit.p['a'])                       # exp(log(a))

creates a function ``f(a)`` such that the prior for 
parameter |~| ``p['a']`` is uniformly distributed between |~| 0
and |~| 0.04, and zero otherwise. The function name |~| ``f``
is arbitrary; ``f(a)`` has a Gaussian prior 0 |~| ± |~| 1. 
This code gives the following output:

.. literalinclude:: eg6-f_a.out

This fit implies that ``a=0.011(13)``
which is almost identical to the result obtained from the log-normal
distribution.

New distributions can be defined
using :meth:`gvar.BufferDict.add_distribution`.
For example, ::

    import lsqfit
    import gvar as gv

    def invf(x):
        return 0.02 + 0.02 * gv.tanh(x)

    def f(x):                                   # not used
        return gv.arctanh((x - 0.02) / 0.02)

    gv.add_parameter_distribution('f', invf)

    prior = {}
    prior['f(a)'] = gv.gvar('0.00(75)')

    def fcn(p, N=len(y)):
        return N * [p['a']]

    fit = lsqfit.nonlinear_fit(prior=prior, data=y, fcn=fcn)
    print(fit)
    print('a =', fit.p['a'])

does a fit with Gaussian parameter ``f(a)``, which forces ``a``
to lie between 0 and 0.04. This fit gives ``a=0.012(12)``, which
again agrees well with log-normal fit. The prior 0±0.75 for ``f(a)``
is chosen to make the prior probability
distribution for parameter ``a`` almost flat
across most (80%) of the interval 0.02±0.02.

.. _faster-fitters:

Faster Fitters
-------------------
|nonlinear_fit| uses fitters from the Gnu Scientific Library (GSL) and/or
from the :mod:`scipy` Python module to do the actual fitting, depending
upon which of these is installed. It is worth trying a different fitter
or fit algorithm
if a fit is causing trouble, since different fitters are optimized for
different problems. The fitter is selected using the ``fitter`` argument
in |nonlinear_fit|. There are currently three fitters available:

  ``fitter='gsl_multifit'``
    The standard GSL least-squares fitter which
    is wrapped in Python class :class:`lsqfit.gsl_multifit`. This is the
    default fitter provided GSL is installed. It offers a wide range
    of options, including several different algorithms that are selected
    by setting |nonlinear_fit| parameter ``alg`` equal to ``'lm'``, ``'lmaccel'``,
    ``'subspace2D'``, ``'dogleg'``, and so on. See the documentation.

  ``fitter='gsl_v1_multifit'``
    The GSL fitter from version |~| 1 of the
    GSL library. This is wrapped in Python class
    :class:`lsqfit.gsl_v1_multifit`. It was the fitter used in :mod:`lsqfit`
    versions earlier than version |~| 9.0. It supports a few
    different algorithms (parameter ``alg``) including
    ``'lmsder'`` and ``'lmder'``.

  ``fitter='scipy_least_squares'``
    The standard :mod:`scipy` least-squares
    fitter, here provided with an :mod:`lsqfit` interface by
    class :class:`lsqfit.scipy_least_squares`. This is the default fitter
    when GSL is not available. It also provides a variety of algorithms
    (set parameter ``method``), and other options, such as loss functions
    for handling outliers. See the :mod:`scipy` documentation.

The default configurations for these fitters are chosen to emphasize
robustness rather than speed, and therefore some of the non-default options
can be much faster. Adding ::

  fitter='gsl_multifit', alg='subspace2D', scaler='more', solver='cholesky'

to |nonlinear_fit|'s argument list, for example, can double or triple
the fitter's speed for  large problems.
The more robust choices are important for challenging fits, but
straightforward fits can be greatly accelerated by using different options.
The ``scipy_least_squares`` fitter can also be much faster than the default.
It is worth experimenting when fits become costly.

Method :meth:`lsqfit.nonlinear_fit.set`
modifies the defaults used by |nonlinear_fit|.
For example, we can make the fast
option mentioned above the default choice for any subsequent fit
by calling::

  lsqfit.nonlinear_fit.set(
      fitter='gsl_multifit',
      alg='subspace2D',
      scaler='more',
      solver='cholesky',
      )

Default values for parameters ``svdcut``,
``debug``, ``maxit``, ``fitter``, and ``tol`` can be reset,
as can any parameters that are
sent to the underlying fitter
(e.g., ``alg``, ``scaler``, and ``solver`` here).
Calling the function with no arguments returns a
dictionary containing the current defaults. ``nonlinear_fit.set(clear=True)``
restores the original defaults.

|nonlinear_fit| is easier to use than the underlying fitters because it can
handle correlated data, and it automatically generates
Jacobian functions for the fitter,
using automatic differentiation. It also is integrated with the :mod:`gvar`
module, which provides powerful tools for error propagation, generating error
budgets, and creating potentially complicated priors for Bayesian fitting. The
underlying fitters are available from :mod:`lsqfit` for use in other
more specialized applications.

Debugging and Troubleshooting
-----------------------------
When a fit refuses to work, the first thing to check is that the data, prior, and fit 
function are properly constructed. Setting parameter ``debug=True`` in 
|nonlinear_fit| causes the code to look for common mistakes and report on 
them with more intelligible error messages. The code also then checks for 
significant roundoff errors in the matrix inversion of the covariance matrix.
It is a good idea to set this parameter in the early stages of any project.

Sometimes the optimization algorithm has trouble finding the true 
minimum of the ``chi**2`` function, leading to unexpectedly poor fits. 
Trying a different algorithm 
(see :ref:`faster-fitters`) will sometimes help. Another option is 
to replace ``svdcut`` with ``eps`` in |nonlinear_fit|, which changes 
the underlying fit functions from which ``chi**2`` is constructed. 
A third option is to try different starting points ``p0``. The 
following code, for example, tries 5 starting points drawn at 
random from the prior::

    import gvar as gv 
    import lsqfit 
    ...
    gv.ranseed(12345)     # gives same results if run script again
    for p0 in gv.raniter(prior, n=5):
        fit = lsqfit.nonlinear_fit(data=data, prior=prior, fcn=fcn, p0=p0)
        print(fit)

Alternatively, simply set parameter ``p0=True`` to generate a random starting
point for each fit.

A common mistake is a mismatch between the format of the data and the
format of what comes back from the fit function. Another mistake is when  a
fit function ``fcn(p)`` returns results containing |GVar|\s  when the
parameters ``p`` are all just numbers (or arrays of numbers). The only way a
|GVar| should get into a fit  function is through the parameters; if a fit
function requires an extra |GVar|, that |GVar| should be turned into a
parameter by adding it to the prior.

Error messages that come from inside the GSL routines used by
|nonlinear_fit| are usually due to errors
in one of the inputs to the fit  (that is, the fit data, the prior, or the fit
function). Again setting ``debug=True`` may catch the errors before they
land in GSL.

Occasionally |nonlinear_fit| appears to go crazy, with gigantic
``chi**2``\s (*e.g.*, ``1e78``). This could be because there is a genuine
zero-eigenvalue mode in the covariance matrix of the data or prior. Such a
zero mode makes it impossible to invert the covariance matrix when evaluating
``chi**2``. One fix is to regulate the covariance matrix used in the fit by setting, 
for example, ``svdcut=1e-8`` (or ``eps=1e-8``) in the call 
to |nonlinear_fit|. Such cuts regulate exact or nearly 
exact zero modes, while leaving important modes mostly unaffected.

Even if regulation works in such a case, the question remains as to why one
of the covariance matrices has a zero mode. A common cause is if the same
:class:`gvar.GVar` was used for more than one prior. For example, one might
think that ::

   >>> import gvar as gv
   >>> z = gv.gvar(1, 1)
   >>> prior = gv.BufferDict(a=z, b=z)

creates a prior 1±1 for each of parameter ``a`` and parameter ``b``.
Indeed each parameter separately is of order 1±1, but in a fit the two
parameters would be forced equal to each other because their priors are both
set equal to the same :class:`gvar.GVar`, ``z``::

   >>> print(prior['a'], prior['b'])
   1.0(1.0) 1.0(1.0)
   >>> print(prior['a']-prior['b'])
   0(0)

That is, while parameters ``a`` and ``b`` fluctuate over a range of
1±1, they fluctuate together, in exact lock-step. The covariance matrix
for ``a`` and ``b`` must therefore be singular, with a zero mode corresponding
to the combination ``a-b``; it is all 1\s in this case::

   >>> import numpy as np
   >>> cov = gv.evalcov(prior.flat)    # prior's covariance matrix
   >>> print(np.linalg.det(cov))       # determinant is zero
   0.0

This zero mode upsets :func:`nonlinear_fit`. If ``a`` and ``b`` are meant to
fluctuate together then an SVD cut as above will give correct results (with
``a`` and ``b`` being forced equal to several decimal places, depending upon
the cut). Of course, simply replacing ``b`` by ``a`` in the fit function would
be even better. If, on the other hand, ``a`` and ``b`` were not meant to
fluctuate together, the prior should be redefined::

   >>> prior = gv.BufferDict(a=gv.gvar(1, 1), b=gv.gvar(1, 1))

where now each parameter has its own :class:`gvar.GVar`. 
This line can be rewritten ::

   >>> prior = gv.gvar(dict(a='1(1)', b='1(1)'))

which is slighlty more succinct.
